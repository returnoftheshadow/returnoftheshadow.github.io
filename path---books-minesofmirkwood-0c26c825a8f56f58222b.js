They searched long and hard for a suitable location eventually\nfinding a long valley which was accessible from the Old Forest Road and close\nto the shelter of Thranduil's palace. Secluded human settlements were also\npresent in the locale providing a local source of revenue and supply of\nfoodstuffs. The mines proved to be rich in semi-precious and precious\ngemstones and as a result the small dwarven colony became extremely rich very\nfast. The colonies chief source of income was through trade with Ost-en-Edhil.\nThe nine human rings of power forged by Sauron were bejewelled with gemstones\nthat were sourced from the Mines of Mirkwood. In return for the supply of\nthese high quality gems Sauron gifted the dwarves with rare, magnificently\ncrafted and bejewelled weapons. Although these weapons were not as great as\nthose crafted by the men of Westernesse or the elves they were still works of\ngreat beauty whilst being practical tools. When Sauron was revealed and the\nnine human lords bent to his power the dwarves renounced their patronage and\nhid their gifted weapons deep within their mine. The colony slowly waned with\ntime and when Thranduil left for the safety of the north and Greenwood became\nMirkwood a slow migration from the mines to the Lonely Mountain began. At the\nend of the third age disaster struck. Lord Angmacar a trusted captain of\nSauron led an invasion force into the valley and the mines were looted and the\nlast surviving miners were slain.</p>\n<p>Aeglos, Sage and Scribe of Loth Lanath.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"The Mines of Mirkwood"}}},pathContext:{path:"/books/minesofmirkwood"}}}});
