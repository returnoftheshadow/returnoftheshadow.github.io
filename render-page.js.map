                  <p>\r\n                    Welcome to Return of the Shadow, Arda the Fourth Age; better known as simply RotS. This is a guide that intends to give a basic knowledge of the game and its workings. It is meant to show you how things work and point you towards areas where you may learn more. The following is a list of questions we commonly hear from new players--so much so that they deserve the status as a frequently asked question. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>What is a MUD?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    A MUD is a game, and like all other games, the main object is to have fun. MUD is short for Multi-User Dimension (or Multi-User Dungeon); an online world, where almost anything is possible. A MUD contains players (other people online playing the game) and mobs (computer controlled creatures in the game that the players interact with). The game is a text-based adventure, where the player roams the world by reading text that describes each room, the mobs and objects in the room and the exits to and from the room. In this way, no graphics are seen, and how the world appears is all up to the imagination and interpretation of the player.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    In most MUDs, players can interact with each other by a system of commands. These commands are all basic, usually consisting of every-day things. Players can chat, (send a message to all of the players in the game with the chat channel on) narrate, (same as chat, but usually in-character information), sing (sing a song), tell (send a private message to a player) or say (send a message to everyone in the character's room). Other commands, including directional commands, are essential. These directional commands are n (north), e (east), s (south) and w (west). All of the commands in RotS can be listed with the command commands.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    You can log in to RotS using telnet or your favorite MUD client (see our links page for our favorites). When you first log in, you will be prompted to into your character's name. If you don't have a character already, you'll have to choose an unused name appropriate for a Tolkien setting and a secure password. You will then be led through the creation process for your new character. Once you've created your character, you'll be able to log in and play it whenever you please.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    The purpose of RotS is to enjoy exploring our Tolkien-inspired world while leveling up and fighting monsters in the classic DikuMUD style. Once you've attained a decent level, you can even begin to participate in the race war between the Free Peoples of Arda and the forces of the Shadow. This is known as PK or player-killing and is an fast-paced, intense fight between two real players.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    While leveling up in RotS, you will also be gathering new equipment to help you in your goals.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Armor will help you survive a beating from both enemy mobiles (computer controlled opponents) and enemy players.</li>\r\n                        <li>For the melee-fighting oriented classes, weapons will be the bread and butter to your damage dealing capacity.</li>\r\n                        <li>Food and water will allow you to continue regenerationg hit points, stamina and movement points.</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <h2>What is Return of the Shadow MUD?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Return of the Shadow is a game based on the Fourth Age of Arda, J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderful world of fantasy. Game play takes place after the destruction of the One Ring. After Sauron's fall, a period of peace was laid about the land, and the Elves, Humans, Dwarves, and Hobbits prospered. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    However, these times of peace were forever threatened by a growing danger in Greenwood the Great. Once again, Orcs and other hideous things squirmed in dark places and began to multiply; the mighty forest became Mirkwood again. In response to these troubling events, the Free Peoples of Arda took alliance once again to combat the still unknown force behind the ever-rising threat from the forest--a threat which became known as the Shadow. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    As a player of RotS, you get to decide whether you will aid the Free Peoples in their fight against the Shadow or fester in the depths on Mirkwood as a minion of its power. Since the Shadow is fledgling and has not come to its true power, players who choose to side with it will play races which have been intentionally weakened. The dark races of Arda face unusual quirks and disadvantages that the Free Peoples needn't worry about; and for this reason, we recommend evil characters only to experienced MUDders.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h1>Gameplay</h1>\r\n                    <h2>Where do I find newbie equipment?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    When you log in for the first time, you will be at the <em>Great Crossroads</em> where you will be presented with instructions on obtaining a basic kit of gear. Any time you die, you will return to the crossroads where you can request another kit. However, keep in mind that newbie kits are meant for new players and, as such, the higher you level the less you will be given when you request a kit.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>Where do I get money and buy things?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    As a starting player, money may seem fairly difficult to come by. However, as you explore Arda and learn where good, easy-to-get loot can be found, you will quickly forget that you ever had problems finding money. If you want to find those good loot spots quickly, keep an eye out for thieves and bandits--these mobiles are almost always aggressive and will attack unwary travelers. Due to this, they commonly congregate around stashes of gear and other stolen goods. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>Where do I practice my skills and spells?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    There are teachers spread across Arda, hidden in towns, forests and other areas. If you're in the same room as a guildmaster, typing practice will present you with a list of skills or spells available for you to learn. Once you have found a guildmaster, simply type practice skill name to spend one of your practice points on a skill. Don't worry about mis-using practice sessions--you can always reset your practices later if you find out that you made some bad decisions. Knowing this, it is fairly easy to wander around your first town and find a teacher willing to improve your skills. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    It is also important to note that RotS' class system is completely dynamic; and as a consequence, you must visit teachers based on what skills you wish to learn--not what class you may have chosen. You will have to utilize abilities from every class in the game, so you will have to learn the locations of many teachers and guildmasters if you wish to truly become a powerful opponent. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Once you are in-game, you can see the list of all warrior and ranger skills by typing man spell list (where man is short for manual); similarly you can view all mystic powers with man power list and all mage spells with man spell list. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>\r\n                        Where is it safe to kill mobiles for experience?\r\n                    </h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    We have gone through a great deal of trouble to make certain that portions of the world are very safe for new, good-aligned characters. In particular, this includes the tract of land between Vinyanost and Maethelburg (as well as the land north of Maethelburg) as well as the lands between Maethelburg and the Elven Halls (this area is known as the Elven Path). Keep in mind that when we say an area is safe, we mean that you can be fairly sure that you will not be attacked by another player while exploring that area; mobiles in those zones can still be very dangerous. Also keep in mind that we have done no such thing for players of the evil side--and this is very intentional. The evil side is meant for experienced players who do not want help. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    When killing mobiles for experience (also known as xping), remember to use the consider command liberally; this command will tell you how strong a mobile is compared to your character. Keep an eye on your health and use the flee command to leave battle if it drops too low; also remember that it is possible (and very likely!) to fail attempts to flee! \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    While xping, it is important to stay healthy as well as keep a good supply of food and light sources available. Once an animal has been killed, you can usually butcher the corpse for meat depending on how scrawny the specimen may have been; to do this, simply type butcher corpse. You can keep yourself alive for weeks at a time by living on butchered meat and fresh ponds. It is also important to keep a number of torches available for long, winter nights and the dark forests of Mirkwood. Remember to visit the dry goods store in your nearest town on a regular basis to keep your supply up to snuff. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>How does player killing work here?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Player killing is perhaps the most important part of RotS; you will eventually map our entire world and try every combination of classes that whets your interest; and it will then be time for you to take your knowledge and use it in player versus player combat. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when performing player killing: \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>You cannot see players of the opposing side on the who list; it is always unknown whether an evil player may be lurking near you, and this is a very exciting component of the game.</li>\r\n                        <li>If you are a good-aligned race (a Human, Wood Elf, Hobbit or Dwarf), it is illegal to kill other good-aligned races. Note that you can see all other good-aligned players when you type who.</li>\r\n                        <li>When you are killed by a player of the opposing faction, they are entitled to loot whatever they please from your corpse. This may mean that you lose absolutely everything to a someone who needs your equipment or is just plain greedy. While we encourage you to get back to your corpse as fast as possible, you have no right to your gear after you've died.</li>\r\n                        <li>Finally, keep in mind that player killing is a preference--not a required part of the game. Many people will choose to forego player killing altogether and it is their right to do so.</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/about.js","import React from 'react';\r\nimport Link from 'gatsby-link';\r\n\r\nexport default({ data }) =>\r\n<div>\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n        <div className=\"row\">\r\n            <div className=\"col-lg-12\">\r\n                <h1 className=\"text-center\">The Book of Arda</h1>\r\n                <p>The lands of Arda are constantly in flux, as the powerful magic of dark and light play out on the land as if it were a stage.

This is a guide that will give someone a\r\n        basic knowledge of the game and its workings. It is meant to show you\r\n        how things work and point you towards areas where you may learn more.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        To help you along until you learn your way around, the following are\r\n    questions that are frequently asked me along with their answers:\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        <strong>Q1.  Where do I find newbie eq?</strong>\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n        A1. As a new player you can gain a set of eq simply by typing 'ask' in\r\n    the room you first appear in ROTS. This will provide you with all the\r\n    basics you need to get yourself going, and this command is also\r\n    re-usuable after each death, and if your new they're will be a few of\r\n    them.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <img src={AskEQ} />\r\n        <p>\r\n        Alternatively-<br />\r\n        Newbie equipment may be found in a number of areas within each city:\r\n        junkyards, training grounds, storage huts, among other things. Each area may\r\n    have a different type of newbie equipment that is based upon the area where it\r\n    is found.  Newbie equipment generally consists of discarded items: Rusted\r\n    weapons and worn out armor.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p><strong>Q2.  Where do I get money and buy things?</strong></p>\r\n        <p>A2. Money is fairly difficult to come by in ROTS, at first. Each character\r\n    starts with enough money to buy some basic things such as a waterskin and some\r\n    cotton clothes. There are a number of weak enemies nearby that may have\r\n    money. There are things to look when finding a creature with cash. The main\r\n    thing to look for is whether or not the enemy is humanoid. The killing of good\r\n    people is generally frowned upon by other players and guards will not stand\r\n    for it and attack you. But the killing of thieves, brigands, and other\r\n    miscreants will go by unpunished.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Q3.  Where do I practice my skills and spells?</strong></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n            A3. There are teachers spread across Arda, hidden in towns, forests, and other\r\n        areas. Many are open and easy to find, it's best to ask another player where a\r\n        guildmaster may be found. Teachers usually specialize in a specific type of\r\n        abilities and spells and seldom learn others. To see the sort of spells you\r\n        can learn type \"MAN SPELL LIST\" To see the mystical powers that maybe learned\r\n        type \"MAN POWER LIST\" To see the skills that one may practice type \"MAN SKILL\r\n        LIST\". When at a guildmaster type \"Practice\" to see a list of the skills and\r\n        spells that may be learned. Type \"Practice {\"<\"}skill{\">\"}\" and you will spend one\r\n        practic e session on that skill.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p><strong>Q4.  Where is it safe to xp \"get experience\"?</strong></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A4. Experience plays a vital role in how the game works.  There are a number\r\n    creatures found everywhere on Arda. The generally safe areas to gain\r\n    experienceare near towns and in wide open areas.  Remember to type \"consider {\"<\"}target{\">\"}\" to see a creatures strength and level compared to yours. Keep an eye\r\n    on your health level and \"flee\" when it drops low, \"Wounded\" is generally a\r\n    safe time to flee so that leaves leeway for failed attempts. Keep in mind that\r\n    consider can be decieving as to the actual strength of an opponent. Generally\r\n    farms that support life are a great place to sharpen ones skill and butcher\r\n    food \"Butcher {\"<\"}target{\">\"}\" for one to eat. Remember dark areas are not usually a\r\n    good place to be without a light, there are spells that allow you to create\r\n    lights and see in the dark, and torches and other lights can be purchased in\r\n    various dry goods shops in each city.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p><strong>Q5.  How does PKILLING work here?</strong></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A5. PKilling is possibly one of the most important things involved in the\r\n    game, but pkill must not be stepped upon with a light touch. Good Race\r\n    vs. Good Race is not allowed and any member of a \"good\" race who is caught\r\n    attacking another member of the \"good\" race will be dealt with harshly.\r\n    On the other hand, there is the other side of the war, two other\r\n    groups of players that play the game. These are the Orcs and Uruk-hai and the\r\n    Third Side, the Magi, or Uruk-Lhuth, These players will pkill each other and\r\n    will pkill the Good Races for fame and equipment. This is a major factor in\r\n    the game. As a beginner you should avoid encountering these races but when you\r\n    are a mature character and have experience in the game and its commands you\r\n    may find yourself to be a very good PKer. Keep in mind Pkilling is a\r\n    preference and is not a required part of the game.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p><strong>Q6.  How do I get the gates of a city open?</strong></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A6.  There are a number of ways for a person to open a gate. First if you are\r\nin a city you may attempt to open the gate or if that does not work \"say open\"\r\nnear a gatekeeper and he will open the door or gate that he is posted to. If\r\nyou are on the other side of a door or gate that has a gatekeeper try knocking\r\non the gate or door and the gatekeeper may open it.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p><strong>Q7.  Other sources of information?</strong></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A7.  The game has a built-in manual that uses a ladder/topic system. To open\r\n    the manual type \"MANUAL\" and the proceed with \"MANUAL {\"<\"}CHAPTER{\">\"} {\"<\"}TOPIC{\">\"}\". (see\r\n    help Manual) The game also maintains a news system that can be read\r\n    anywhere. \"NEWS\" will bring up a list of the current news topics.  \"News\r\n    {\"<\"}topic #{\">\"} will bring up that specific news article. There are also bulletin\r\n    boards for mortal news, and in-character topics, stationed throughout the\r\n    towns, to use the board system \"look board\" and then \"read board {\"<\"}topic #{\">\"}.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p><strong>Q8.   What are some of the more useful commands we may use on here?</strong></p>\r\n    <p>A8.  A list of the various commands can be seen by typing \"commands\". Further\r\n    help on each command can be gained by typing \"help {\"<\"}command{\">\"}\".  Some of the\r\n    more useful commands that you will want to read about are: Alias, assist,\r\n    butcher, compare, equipment, flee, inventory, rent, quit, rest,score, info,\r\n    set, sleep, where, and who. These are commands you will find yourself using\r\n    quite often during your travels through Arda so it is best to get familiar\r\n    with them as quickly as possible.</p>\r\n    <p><strong>Q9.  Why won't some people help me?</strong></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A9. While it is generally nice to help people, there is no law that dictates\r\nthat higher levels should help newibes. Certain people have a belief system\r\nthat says that they shouldn't help newbies, others dont concern themselves\r\nwith it. As a newbie, it is important to realize that higher levels may or may\r\nnot help you with equipment or gold - its their choice. Usually, if anyone\r\nfeels like giving out some equipment or gold, they will give it\r\nfreely. Begging is highly disliked and if you plan on getting along with\r\nothers, do NOT beg.\r\n    </p>\r\n    <p><strong>Q10. What is spam?</strong></p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    A10. Spam is generally considered the repetition of some action that causes\r\nsomeones screen to be full of useless information. If someone accuses you of\r\n\"spamming\" them, it means that your constant yelling/narrating/shouting/\r\netc. has made them unable to do anything. As you might have already guessed,\r\nspamming is frowned upon by management.\r\n    </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/getting-started.js","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/ask_equipment.1ee0d60b.jpg\";\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/pages/images/ask_equipment.jpg\n// module id = 329\n// module chunks = 0","import React from \"react\"\r\nimport Link from \"gatsby-link\"\r\nimport Warrior from \"../pages/images/warrior.jpg\"\r\nimport Ranger from \"../pages/images/ranger.jpg\"\r\nimport Mystic from \"../pages/images/mystic.jpg\"\r\nimport Mage from \"../pages/images/mages.jpg\"\r\nimport Races from \"../components/races\"\r\nimport YellowButtonLG from \"../components/Buttons/YellowButtonLG\";\r\nimport RedButtonLG from '../components/Buttons/RedButtonLG';\r\nimport { navigateTo } from \"gatsby-link\"\r\nimport NewsPreview from \"../components/NewsPreview\";\r\nimport ClassPreview from \"../components/Classes/ClassPreview\";\r\n\r\n\r\nexport default ({ data }) => \r\n<div>\r\n    <div className=\"jumbotron\">\r\n        <div className=\"container\">\r\n            <h1>Welcome to Return of the Shadow!</h1>\r\n            <p>Return of the Shadow is a game based on the Fourth Age of Arda, J.R.R.

The average ranger's understanding of\r\n                                magical arts is only mediocre; but rangers, being attuned to natural\r\n                                environs, are completely uncomfortable with clerical duties and the world\r\n                                of wraiths.\r\n                                </ClassPreview>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"row\">\r\n                            <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n                                <ClassPreview\r\n                                    path=\"/classes/mystic\"\r\n                                    title=\"Mystic\"\r\n                                    image={Mystic}>\r\n                                Mystics are rare in Arda; while most of Arda's inhabitants avoid wraiths\r\n                                and their kin at all costs, these daring souls have heightened their\r\n                                perception of the spiritual world in hopes of coming in contact with its\r\n                                undead inhabitants.  However, the common mystic does not narrow its scope of\r\n                                study to the clerical arts: most mystics are able to employ the arts of\r\n                                magery with decent success.  But as a consequence of this rigorous mental\r\n                                training, mystics are left with very little training as a fighter, and with\r\n                                a dismal knowledge of wilderness the outdoors.\r\n                                </ClassPreview>\r\n                            </div>\r\n                            <div className=\"col-lg-6\">\r\n                                <ClassPreview\r\n                                    path=\"/classes/mage\"\r\n                                    title=\"Mage\"\r\n                                    image={Mage}>\r\n                                Mages are experts of those magical arts which emtail the manipulation of\r\n                                the physical world: fire, lightning, ice and darkness.  In general, mages\r\n                                make heavy use of their spells to cause as much physical harm to their\r\n                                victim as possible.  However, the arts of magery also include control of\r\n                                the physical body and scrying magics: teleportation and informative spells.\r\n                                Mages generally receive a decent training in the aspects of the Wraith\r\n                                world, and commonly find themselves knowledgeable enough in the arts of\r\n                                animals and wilderness.  However, as mages spend most of their time\r\n                                enthralled in intellectual pursuit, they neglect their physical bodies and\r\n                                their

To design your own class, enter values in either the level or point boxes below; to update the rest of the form, tab or click out of the text box which you most recently altered. If you'd like to use a default or player-recommend class as a starting point, simply click the appropriate button below.</p>\r\n                            <p>Keep in mind that Uruk-Hais receive a flat 3 level deduction to their mage level and that Common Orcs can only utilize two thirds of their real level values.</p>\r\n                            <p>Click one of the buttons below to load a premade class. To create your own click in the text boxes below and type in the numbers you want. Then to adjust the other boxes just click or tab out of the box. If you enter non-numbers it will not work properly and thats your own problem to fix.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div className=\"col-lg-12\">\r\n

So when Aulë picked up a great hammer to smite the Seven Fathers and destroy his presumptuous creations, they shrank back in fear and begged for mercy.\r\n\r\nIlúvatar was however not willing to suffer that the Dwarves should come before the Firstborn (Elves), and he decreed that the Seven Fathers should sleep underground and should not come forth until the Firstborn had awakened.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <h1>Abilities</h1>\r\n                <p>Due to the Dwarves high strength and very high constitution they make great warriors.</p>\r\n                <table className=\"table\">\r\n                    <thead>\r\n                        <tr>\r\n                            <th>Strength</th>\r\n                            <th>Intelligence</th>\r\n                            <th>Will</th>\r\n                            <th>Dexterity</th>\r\n                            <th>Constitution</th>\r\n                            <th>Learning Ability</th>\r\n                        </tr>\r\n                    </thead>\r\n                    <tbody>\r\n                        <tr>\r\n                            <td>High</td>\r\n                            <td>Normal</td>\r\n                            <td>Low</td>\r\n                            <td>Very Low</td>\r\n                            <td>Very High</td>\r\n                            <td>Low</td>\r\n                        </tr>\r\n                    </tbody>\r\n                </table>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/races/tmp_dwarves.js","import React from 'react'\r\nimport harads from \"../images/race_haradrim.jpg\"\r\n\r\nexport default() =>\r\n<div>\r\n    <div className=\"container\">\r\n        <div className=\"row\">\r\n            <div className=\"col-lg-4\">\r\n                <img src={harads} className=\"race-profile\" />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"col-lg-8\">\r\n                <h1>Haradrims</h1>\r\n                <p>\r\n                The Haradrim, known in Westron as the Southrons and once as the \"Swertings\" by Hobbits, were a race of Men from Harad in the region of Middle-earth directly south of Gondor.

These 'meetings' usually ended up becoming a rampant celebration of\\nthe friendship enjoyed between the two kingdoms as such a copious amount of\\nale and wine was brought for all to enjoy.

Closing the cellar door tight behind him,  he ran to\\nanswer his employers call. With a crooked half smile on his face, he chuckled\\n'This is going to be one of those days'.    Like all hard days work, it passed\\nwith surprising speed. Day quickly fell into night, and before Aoron knew it\\nhe was shutting up the Inn for the evening unaware that it would be for the\\nlast time.  Below the trapdoor in the cooks kitchen, the usually pitch black\\ncellar was basking in a haunting orange hue, the type of glow that accompanies\\nfire. The oil lamp used earlier to illuminate the perpetual darkness was\\nuncovered and had burnt low. The wick had fragmented and its hot remains had\\nfallen on an open crate of Longbottom leaf. Quickly consuming the dried\\ntinder, the fire spread among the crates and barrels  until the entire cellar\\nwas ablaze. In the corner of the cellar the two barrels of Dragons breath\\nwhiskey, along with many crates of spirits began to burn.

Shards of rubble began to rain from the air. Shields! shouted the most\\nsenior guard. Trumpets rang out throughout the night air, as guards and\\ncitizens alike were roused from their sleep coming out of their homes all\\nlooked on in horror, as the explosion that had roused them had rained down\\nburning rubble upon a portion of the city.  A company of royal Gondorian\\nhousehold guards roused from their sleep by a deep thud, looked northward over\\nthe grassy Anduin plain. Several miles lay between them and its source but the\\nglowing red sky told them all they needed to know.   'Make ready! fast march,\\nfall into formation, we ride this hour'. 'Keep your eyes sharp and swords\\nready!' shouted the commanding officer. Riding along side his superior a young\\nknight spoke 'Sir, is it an attack?'.  'Im not sure Irildean, either way\\nVinyanost burns.' With that the company broke camp hastily and rode with all\\nspeed northwards.   The frigid predawn cold brought with it fog from the great\\nriver, helping the effort to douse the fire that consumed the city overnight.\\nAt midday the company of Gondorian knights entered what remained of the city\\nof Vinyanost, now smouldering in a cold drizzle. The streets were covered in a\\nblack soot the people black faced were cold and huddling in groups trying to\\nkeep warm.  'Lieutenant' bellowed the captain of the Gondorian forces.  'Sir'\\nreplied a tall blond man.  Inhaling deeply the captain spoke 'Make camp, set\\nup a tent for the injured. Get every able bodied man and woman to search the\\nrubble for survivors. Send riders north for help. Organise hunting and logging\\ndetails, and set up a fortified perimeter around the old barracks. These\\npeople need food, shelter and fire. Go.'   'Sir' replied the young lieutenant.\\nScratching his head the captain grimaced. 'One more thing Lieutenant, send out\\nscouts east of the Anduin, I want to know if something is coming before it\\narrives. That fire last night could have been seen for miles around.'

While using the defending spec you can reduce all incoming physical damage up to 80% but getting hit reduces the counters and the duration of the skill. Natural attacks has been aligned with the light fighting specialization and to some degree the wild fighting spec. Bite and rend has been aligned with heavy fighting specialization and to some degree the wild fighting spec.</p>\\n<p>So to summarize we are trying to make four different play styles for Beornings. If you want the majority of your damage to come from natural attacks pick the light fighting spec. If you want the majority of your damage to come from manual abilities, bite and rend, pick the heavy fighting spec. If you want to be a generalist pick wild fighting and if you want to be a tank go with defending spec.</p>\\n<p>With all these changes to the Beorning race we are going to keep the testing port open for another week.

They departed in a ship that bore\\nthe wings and the figurehead of a swan from the harbors of the Grey Havens\\nof Cirdan, the Shipwright.  Their sailing was wonderful, even for the hobbits\\nthat were timorous of sailing and the matters that dealt with boats and riding\\nupon water.</p>\\n<p>   Gandalf sat near the bow with his head in his hands, seemingly deep in thought.  He\\nhad a pipe in his mouth, and he was muttering soft, quiet words to himself.  Upon his\\nface, there was a broad smile and the lines of age that had once bejeweled his\\nforehead and cheeks seemed to disappear.  At first glance, he seemed much younger\\nthan he used to look, no longer weary and bent, but tall, straight, and proud.  A second\\nglance would let one see that he was still the same old Gandalf, hair as white as new-\\nfallen snow, a long shaggy beard, and deep, dark, understanding eyes.  All of the crew\\nof Cirdan's ship was alive and bustling with song and speech.  Frodo and Bilbo\\nmarveled at how joyous these elves appeared, and both wondered why this was so.</p>\\n<p>   Bilbo, then finding his thoughts too much to ponder, spoke aloud and asked why\\nthere was so much celebration, despite the fact that he knew that the Ring had been\\ndestroyed, and Sauron's power had been vanquished at last.  An elf stood tall and\\nspoke with eloquent words, saying, \\\"We are returning to Aman! The Blessed Realm!\\nwhere the rest of our kindred dwells!  Oh how wonderful it will be to see the splendor\\nof Valinor, and the place where the Two Trees once stood!  Oh how I have longed for\\nthis moment!\\\"  The elf then sat down and began to sing a song about the Elder Days,\\nthe days when Middle-earth was free from trouble.</p>\\n<p>   Beside Gandalf sat Elrond Half-Elven, and Galadriel, the Lady of the Golden Wood.\\nThe three keepers of the three elf rings were departing for their home from which they\\nwere spawned.  The three were speaking loudly, and clearly, so that Frodo and Bilbo\\ncould hear their conversation.  While they listened, they were reminded once more\\nthat Gandalf was one of the Maiar, a people of the Valar.  He had not always been\\nknown by as Gandalf.  In his youth, he was Olorin, one of the mightiest, and perhaps\\nthe wisest of the Maiar.  Amongst him was Sauruman, who was known as Curumo,\\nRadagast, who was known as Aiwendil, and Alatar, and Pallando.  These were the\\nfive wizards who were chosen by the Valar to go into Middle-earth.  According to\\nGandalf, he alone was successful in his mission, and the others failed, for they were\\ndrawn to the lands of Middle-earth, and fell in love with its creatures, or had a lust for\\npower.</p>\\n<p>   Galadriel spoke of her people, the Galadrim, whom she loved dearly.  She\\nmentioned that Celeborn had chosen to stay in Lothlorien for a while yet to enjoy his\\nlast days upon those fair Golden Woods.  Elrond spoke of his father, and his mother,\\nand how he wished to see his mother, Elwing once more.  The histories of these\\npeople had been great and extensive, and for that reason, they shall not be told here.</p>\\n<p>   Now Bilbo and Frodo were filled with joy and gladness at hearing the happiness of\\nall of these people.  Before, Galadriel had seemed filled with a lot of grief, and\\nsadness.  But now, she seemed a young elf-maiden, filled with happiness and bereft of\\nher woes.  Both Bilbo and Frodo smiled and joined in a few of the songs that the elves\\nsang, and forgot about their worries for a while.</p>\\n<p>   After many days of sailing upon those tranquil, crystal clear waters, they began to\\nsee a massive pinnacle of stone rise up out of the horizon.  All of the elves stood up\\nand shouted for joy, causing their songs to rise up and laughter to fill the air.  Some of\\nthem proclaimed, \\\"Taniquetil! Home of Manwe Sulimo, King of Arda!  There too\\ndwells Varda Elentari, Queen of the Stars! A Elbereth! Gilthoniel! silivren penna\\nmiriel o menel aglar elenath! Na-chaered palan-diriel o galadhremmin ennorath,\\nFanuilos, le linnathon nef aear, si nef aearon!\\\"  This they sang, and the rest of the\\nverses of the song, in reverence to their Queen that they would soon meet.</p>\\n<p>   The hobbits were filled with a sudden joy, for they had never seen a pinnacle so\\nhigh and mighty before in their lives.  The ship seemed to be gaining speed, and the\\nhorizon began to be filled with glorious, lofty mountains.  Taniquetil stood amidst\\nthose mountains, living up to its name as the highest mountain in all of Arda.  Frodo\\nwas filled with a sudden short fear, for he had never before realized what majesty the\\nrealm of the Valar had actually held.  He then realized that he was only viewing the\\noutermost part of Valinor, the Pelori, those mountains that had been raised by the\\nValar as a defense against Melkor and the evils that he had wrought.</p>\\n<p>   The ship landed upon the shore of Valinor, and many tall elves, with incredibly\\nbright faces greeted the ship.  They were filled with great mirth, for they were finally\\nmeeting the lost ones of their Kindred.  These elves were known as the Sea-elves, a\\nbranch of the Teleri.  These elves dwelt at Alqualonde, the haven of the Teleri.  These\\nelves were called Sea-elves, for their love of the sea, and of sailing.  Of all of the elves\\nin Middle-earth, these were the ones who were the most skilled at shipbuilding and\\nsailing.  There, the company was received with great joy and happiness, and were\\ntaken into the homes of the Teleri for several days and housed, fed, and told of the\\ngoings-on of the time.</p>\\n<p>   A few days passed, and it came time to go before Manwe Sulimo, in order to receive\\ntheir official welcome to Valinor.  Thus the company did, and the whole way there,\\nthe hobbits were filled with a small fear, yet their hearts were filled with joy.  They\\ntraveled up the slopes of Taniquetil, and found at the top a massive mansion, overlaid\\nwith the richest jewels and stones of the entire world.  They entered, and many Maiar\\nand other noble lords of the Valar stood.  Eonwe, the Herald of Manwe was there, and\\nhe greeted them with a deep bow.  He beckoned them to follow him down an\\nincredibly, richly decorated hall.</p>\\n<p>   The hall opened up into a massive chamber, which was adorned with many\\npaintings and jewels, and the airs of the world could be seen as the ceiling.  Thus\\nEonwe proclaimed, \\\"Lord Manwe, King of Arda, here are the members of the alliance\\nof the Ring!\\\"  He announced all of their names, and titles, and then bowed low to the\\nground, and stepped back.  The members of the company bowed low in return, and\\nfell to their knees before Manwe.  Manwe smiled, and bade them to stand.  He then\\nstood long silent, staring and pondering at each individual.  After a long silence, he\\nfinally spoke.  His voice was soft, understanding, stern, compassionate, and powerful.</p>\\n<p> \\\"Your deeds have not gone unheard, friends.  It is a wonderful thing that you now\\nstand before me in my court.  For your deeds and troubles in the lands, it is only\\nappropriate that you dwell in Valinor, and remain here ere the end of the world.\\nOlorin, it greatly saddens me to hear that Alatar and Pallando have not been heard of\\nand supposedly still dwell in the lands of East Middle-earth.  Sorrow filled my heart\\nwhen I heard that Curumo had betrayed us, and had decided to join Sauron and his\\nevil thoughts.  Folly it was when Sauron joined Melkor and his foul plans during the\\nGreat Music.  But alas!  He is now vanquished, and his power is gone!\\\"  Each of the\\ncompany stood silent in awe and amazement of the power of Manwe, and his\\nsplendor.</p>\\n<p>   Manwe then addressed Frodo and Bilbo directly.  \\\"For your bravery in the\\nface of utter danger, and the finding of the ring before Sauron did, you are held\\nin positions of highest honor amongst all hobbits in the world.  Here you will\\ndwell, amongst the Vanyar, the Noldor, and the Teleri until the end of time.  In\\norder to do so, you must be given a gift.  For all of those who dwell here posses\\nthis gift.  If you will, please kneel.  The hobbits did so, shaking slightly as they\\nbent forward.  Manwe then began chanting softly, then his voice rose into a\\nbeautiful song.  The notes were fair, and caused shivers to run down the hobbits'\\nspines, and all of the others in that hall stood silent whilst Manwe sang.  The\\nwords were undecipherable, but were strangely sweet.  The tongue was that of\\nValinor, now long forgotten in Middle-earth, save by very few.</p>\\n<p>   The hobbits then felt completely different, as if their hearts had been removed\\nof all of their sorrows, and their weariness was swept away.  They felt a feeling\\nsimilar to that of an adrenaline rush, yet their bodies remained the same.  All\\ntime seemed to have stopped before them, and they felt like they had just been\\nborn anew.  The world seemed different to their eyes, yet it was the same.\\nManwe then stopped singing, and said, \\\"I have given you the gift that only the\\nValar, the Maiar, and the Eldar posses.  You are now immortal.\\\"  The hobbits\\nrose, feeling different, yet the same.  They bowed low to the ground, and\\nthanked him for their gift, and Manwe then said, \\\"It is only fitting and proper to\\ndo such a thing to the bravest hobbits that Illuvatar, himself had ever thought of\\ncreating.\\\"</p>\\n<p>   Thus it came to be that the members of the company dwelled in Valinor.  They\\neach had a house to themselves, where they were appointed a servant.  The days\\npassed by, but time seemed to not exist to the hobbits.  Bilbo and Frodo both\\nmissed their old home of Bag End back in the Shire.  So it was their wish to\\nhave built for them a home that was much like their old one.  Thus their wish\\nwas granted, and a few of the Maiar gathered round a flat section of land nigh\\nthe center of Valmar.  There, they chanted their sweet music and caused the\\nground to rise before the hobbits' eyes.  Then with a little bit of help from the\\nhobbits, that tract of land began to take shape and form, and soon to their\\ndisbelief, it seemed as if Bag End was right before their eyes.  The Maiar bowed\\nlow when their singing was finished and stated, \\\"We have fulfilled your request,\\nand from what we have learned, it would most please you to see your old home.\\nThough this is not your old home.  It is merely a version exactly as yours used to\\nbe.  You will find that every hall and room and burrow and mark inside the hill\\nwill be exactly as you remember your old Bag End to be.</p>\\n<p>   Bilbo and Frodo both stood speechless outside their home, and could not\\nbelieve what happened before their eyes.  Bag End was before them, exactly as\\nit had been when they last saw it in the Shire before setting out upon the Great\\nEastern Road.  Their garden outside was exactly the same, filled with flowers,\\nand plants, and vegetables.  Frodo then sighed to himself and thought about\\nSam.  He would be all alone in the Shire, but hopefully he would find some way\\nto make life enjoyable.  Frodo and Bilbo entered the Hill, and found everything\\nto be exactly the same, just as that Maiar had said it would be.  All of Bilbo's\\nold possessions were there, along with Frodo's.  It was just as if they had never\\nleft home in the first place.</p>\\n<p>   Almost immediately, Bilbo began to tidy things up, because the house was just\\nhow he left it: halfway in a mess.  Frodo laughed at him and helped the old\\nhobbit around with things.  Suddenly, Frodo noticed something that he hadn't\\nbefore.  Bilbo appeared to be quite young.  A lot younger than he looked when\\nFrodo and He were riding the ship to Aman.  Bilbo looked as if he were back in\\nhis sixties!  He seemed like a bustling young hobbit with the opportunity for\\nadventure around every corner.  Bilbo never seemed to notice his regained\\nyouth, and Frodo never mentioned it to him.  He simply thought that this was\\nanother gift from the Valar.  Perhaps because the Ring caused him to never\\nchange his appearance, and once he was without the ring, his appearance\\nchanged drastically, the Valar had mercy for him, and restored his old\\nappearance.</p>\\n<p>   For many years, Frodo and Bilbo had a wonderful time in Valinor, though the\\ntime didn't seem to exist to them.  They would often gather together every day\\nwith a host of elves and Maiar, and have a jolly good time, telling stories,\\nsinging songs, and enjoying the bliss and peacefulness of the hidden realm.\\nBilbo was a very fondly loved person, for the elves of that place would listen to\\nhis tales of his journeys for hours at a time without end.  Frodo too had his great\\ndeal of attention; the elves would always ask questions about what the dark land\\nwas like, for most of them had never seen it before, first hand.  They often\\nwondered what the inside of Orodruin was like, and how Gollum was really\\nmisunderstood, but the Ring had corrupted his heart for too long.</p>\\n<p>   Thus many more years passed by, and it seemed that time did not exist to\\nFrodo.  He would often go about walking through Valinor, exploring its many\\nhidden dells and vales, and all of the joys of the gardens of Yavanna and\\nspeaking with the mightiest of the Valar, the Aratar, when he could.  From them,\\nhe learned many things about the world, and many things that no mortal man\\ndare had known.  The Valar were still very powerful and mysterious to him, and\\nhe both feared and loved them.</p>\\n<p>   During one of his explorations of the land, Frodo walked upon a fair garden,\\nwith pools of water that glittered like starlight.  Next to the largest of these pools\\nsat an elf-maiden.  Her voice was like a thousand nightingales, or all of the\\nchoruses of the Maiar put together.  Her hair was fair, and her eyes were dark\\nblue.  She was dressed in attire of light white, and she bore a smile upon her\\nface.  She was one of the Vanyar, the Highest of the Elves.  Being one of the\\nhigh elves, there was a strange oddity about her.  She was rather short for an elf.\\nShe measured nearly four feet and eight inches tall.</p>\\n<p>   Her height did not seem to bother her, and she sat beside the pool singing a\\nsong of strange sorrow.  Her sad words were sweet to hear, but one could tell\\nthat they were full of lament.  Frodo could not understand her words, for he was\\nskilled only in the language of the Silvan Elves.  She saw Frodo immediately,\\nand stopped her singing.  She smiled at him, and greeted him in her own, fair\\ntongue.  Frodo was speechless.  His feet were rooted to the ground, and he could\\nnot find any words to comment on her.  Her magnificence and beauty surpassed\\nall of the Valar and Maiar, and every other elf that he had ever seen in his life\\nbefore.  She, he accounted as the fairest creature upon the Earth.</p>\\n<p>   She smiled at him and stared at him for a long time, pondering what he might\\nbe thinking, and finally broke the silence.  She spoke in his tongue.  \\\"Greetings,\\nFrodo Baggins.  I have long been sitting by this pool alone, mourning my\\nloneliness.  Great is it that you have come to see me.  I have attended several of\\nthe telling of your stories, and have admired you for quite a long time.\\\"  Frodo\\nstood still rooted to the ground.  He grasped deep down inside for something to\\nreply with, and he thought for a long while in silence.  Finally, he found a few\\nwords. \\\"It is an honor to be admired by such a fair and lovely being as yourself.\\nSurely, you should not be mourning by this pool in the fair gardens of Valinor?\\nYou should be off dancing and singing and laughing with the rest of your\\npeople!\\\"  She smiled at his words, and said, \\\"I should be doing so.  But alas, I\\nam not comfortable being with my people.  I love them all dearly, but they all\\nmake me feel so different.  I feel small when I am with them, for I am small.  All\\nof the elves of Valinor are tall, and I am small.  It is quite lonely indeed!\\\"</p>\\n<p>   With the words, Frodo smiled, and said, \\\"But fair maiden, do not feel alone,\\nfor I myself am short, and I feel all alone, except for my dear old Bilbo.  There\\nare no other hobbits here besides him, and I indeed have longed for someone to\\nbe with.\\\"  She smiled at him, keeping her eyes steadily upon him.  Frodo felt\\nvery nervous, quite unlike he had ever felt in his life, except for a few times\\nabout a few of the female hobbits of the Shire and perhaps a few of the other\\nelves he had seen.  But he had never felt this way about an elf to this degree.\\nShe was the fairest upon the fairest of all of the Elves in his mind.</p>\\n<p>   Frodo then said, \\\"Maiden, may I ask your name of you?\\\" and she replied, \\\"My\\nname is Niwiel.  I am one of the Vanyar.\\\"  From that moment onward in the\\ntwilit gardens of the star pools, Frodo and Niwiel spent much time together.\\nThey learned a great deal about each other, and soon found that they both had a\\nlot in common.  Soon, they fell deeply in love.  So great was the love of Frodo\\nand Niwiel that they saw past their differences, and saw only each others hearts\\nand souls, and their love for each other and everything good that lived or\\ndwelled on the Earth.</p>\\n<p>   After many years of life together, Niwiel bound herself to Frodo, and in doing\\nso, they were wed.  Time passed and the happiness of Niwiel and Frodo grew\\nincredibly.  Never again would they feel alone, and Bilbo took her as an\\nimmediate part of the family.  After quite some time, Frodo and Niwiel had\\nseveral children.  These children were very special, and they were quite\\nmarveled at.  They were short in stature, and were very fair to behold, much like\\nNiwiel was.  Their ears were more sharply pointed than normal hobbits' ears,\\nand their vision was extraordinary.  In their outer appearance, they looked\\nexactly like hobbits, except for the overall fairness of their features.</p>\\n<p>   Because Niwiel and Frodo were short, their offspring were short as well.  The\\nfirst of these were two girls, and two boys.  They were very radiant to look\\nupon.  They all proved very nimble, and were swift in their movements while in\\nthe wild.  The boys' names were Feando and Daedro, and were like Frodo in\\nappearance and mind.  The girls' names were Nimrodel and Nilwe.  Niwiel\\nnamed the two girls after names that she had conceived in her mind and had\\nloved.  These four were the first of the \\\"high-hobbits\\\", the offspring of a hobbit\\nand a high-elf.</p>\\n<p>   Thus, many years of the world went past, and the \\\"hobbits\\\" continued to\\nprosper, and with the help of the Ainur, expanded their home into a massive part\\nof Valinor, which was much like the Shire, with a mixture of the woods of\\nLothlorien in it.  It was a wonderful part of the land, and belonged to the\\n\\\"hobbits\\\".  (Note that when I write \\\"hobbits\\\", I mean \\\"high-hobbits\\\".)</p>\\n<p>   After quite some time, signs of trouble began to brew once more in the lands\\nof Eastern Middle-earth.  Rumor was spreading that a dreadful power was\\nemerging once again, but who it was, was unknown.  The shadow was spreading\\nrapidly, and many forces of Uruk-Hai and Orcs who weren't already influenced\\nby it were falling under its sway.  The warriors and peoples of Middle-earth\\nwere in need of help, and most of the more experienced fighters of the Third\\nAge, who were mostly elves, had already passed away into the West.  Middle-\\nearth was in need of help.</p>\\n<p>   Hearing this, Manwe Sulimo himself was shocked, and quite disturbed.  He\\nsent petitions around to the greatest of his maiar, asking if any of them would be\\nwilling to overthrow the decision to leave the peoples of Middle-earth alone, and\\naid them in their trouble.  None of the maiar, however, would go, for they feared\\nthat if they went, they would fall sway beneath the lusts of the world.  Then,\\nManwe asked the greatest of the high-elves if they would go, but none of them\\nwished to leave their beloved peaceful lands, to go to a belligerent, hostile land,\\nwhere they would be subject to death and misery.</p>\\n<p>   His distress overcoming him, Manwe turned to the \\\"hobbits\\\".  At first, none of\\nthem were willing to leave.  However, hearing the distress of this fair Arata, a\\nhandful of them stepped forward, and accepted the task.  Manwe explained that\\nonce they left Valinor, they would never be able to return.  The newly formed\\ncompany understood this, and a leader amongst them said \\\"Fair Manwe, we\\nunderstand that we shall more than likely never see our families again, but we\\ndesire greatly to see the lands that our elders came from, and we desire ever\\nmore to protect them from harm and the evils of the world.\\\"  Manwe smiled and\\nshed a tear at this brave \\\"hobbit's\\\" bravery.</p>\\n<p>   Manwe then gathered all of the peoples of Valinor together, all around the\\noutside of Valmar.  He then announced the departure of these twelve brave\\n\\\"hobbits\\\", and bid them all farewell.  The \\\"hobbits\\\" said good-bye to their\\nfamilies, friends, and other loved-ones, and set off for the haven of Alqualonde.\\nThere, they were given a ship of mighty strength, and were blessed by the Teleri\\nwith many farewell gifts.  The ship was white, and it shone brightly in the light\\nof the sun.  The light that sparkled upon the waters of that fair bay was reflected\\nupon the base of the ship.  The figurehead was carved in the shape of a swan,\\nand the chief mariner of Alqualonde told them that it was a very fast ship, and it\\nwould not make them stray from their course as long as it was set and kept\\nstraight and true.</p>\\n<p>   Thus, the \\\"hobbits\\\" left Valinor, and turning around, saw the mighty peak of\\nTaniquetil, shining brightly in the sunlight.  They would never see Valinor\\nagain.  Their sailing was quick, and after several days, they arrived at the Grey\\nHavens of Cirdan.  There, they left their ship, and took all that they could carry\\nupon their backs.  They were each given a pack-mule to carry their gear, but\\nthese \\\"hobbits\\\" loved their mules, and spared them as much weight as each\\ncould.  They wandered over the land, and eventually ended up in the Shire.\\nThe leader of this company was Grondo Baggins.  His younger brothers, who\\nwere all fair-skinned, and beautiful to behold, accompanied him.  They were all\\nrather short and skinny, but not too chubby.  They entered the Shire, and\\nimmediately fell in love with it.  It was much like their home in Valinor, and the\\nfirst thing that caught their sight was the Hill at Bag End.  It was exactly like the\\nBag End in Valinor, and they greatly desired to keep it.  So all of that company\\npooled together their money, and bought the residence from the Gamgees who\\nlived there.  They were descendents of Samwise Gamgee.

The \\\"hobbits\\\" bound\\nthemselves to other mortal female hobbits, and in doing so, were forced to give\\nup their immortality.  Over ages, the blood of the high-hobbits dwindled, yet the\\ngenerations of Bagginses remained very nimble and fair-skinned, and fair to\\nbehold.

Hundreds, maybe thousands were gathered along the streets as\\nthe city guard marched against an opposing army consisting mostly\\nof brothers and kinsmen. A coup had begun, and the town was awash\\nwith anger, fear, and anticipation. As Eshmanin walked dutifully\\nalongside his employer and mentor Sirgil he took in the chaos around\\nhim, and thought back to how it all began.</p>\\n<p>Months ago, in a wooden shack alongside the western wall of Dale, the\\nmen had gathered. There, their leader and commander of the guard recited\\na great and overwhelming speech. Dale had come under great economic\\nstress since it was rebuilt so many decades ago. At the base of the\\nLonely Mountain, the dwarves sold their powerful armor and weapons. To\\nthe south, the great Esgoroth held all the glory and covered most\\nother markets. Crunched between these two giants, Dale had started\\nto become a very poor place to live. Many years ago, Dale had given up\\nthe regal bloodline in favor of an elected official. Sirgil blamed\\nthis foolishness and the pompous mayor, Raymond, for the economic\\ndecline in Dale. He then rallied his men and laid plans to take the\\nthrone of Dale, which was rightfully his as he was a descendant of\\nthe ancient King Bard.</p>\\n<p>And now, almost two-thirds of the city's guard marched in the\\nstreet. Eshmanin began to sweat in the summer heat, as they marched\\ncloser and closer to the mayor's mansion. He looked at his\\nlongtime friend, Sirgil, and could see why the men so easily followed\\nhim. He was tall and had an aura of leadership and charisma\\nsurrounding him. No blood had been so far, but Eshmanin feared this\\nwould soon change.</p>\\n<p>Finally, after the long trek through the streets, they were within\\nsight of the mayor's mansion. There, at the front steps stood\\nthe remainder of the city's guard and many civilians with weapons\\ndrawn. Sirgil approached and called to the man who appeared to be\\nleading these men. His name was Valin and he was the highest\\nranking officer that was not a part of Sirgil's planned coup.\\nHalt! cried Valin, \\\"I hereby demand that you cease and desist, Sirgil\\\".\\nThe young man walked strongly towards the revolting army. Eshmanin was\\nshocked at the kid's courage. Sirgil did not reply for some time, but\\nfinally he spoke. \\\"Step aside, subordinate. I am here to claim the throne\\nof Dale, which is rightfully mine.</p>\\n<p>Eshmanin glanced at Sirgil. He had expected him to make some statement\\nof purpose, about the economy and the laws and all the other reasons\\nthey were usurping the town's leader. \\\"There would be plenty of time\\nfor explaining that later\\\", he thought. He also thought it strange\\nthat Valin was not afraid of Sirgil. Sirgil easily stood six inches\\nover Valin and was hands down the best swordsman in the city.\\nValin glanced across the crowd and lowered his sword. In a much\\ncalmer voice he said \\\"Sirgil, we don't want a war. Do do this. We are\\nyour brothers.\\\" Sirgil nodded and stepped forward. He put his hand\\nof Valin's shoulder and said, \\\"Son, I know it is hard, but you must let\\nme do this. It is my destiny. Besides, you are outnumbered\\nand outmatched.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Valin conceded, and said with a sigh \\\"I know, that is why I don't want\\nto die here protecting my city, but you know that I must.\\\" Valin\\nthen stood tall and quickly raised his weapon to engage Sirgil in\\ncombat. However, long between he could bring his sword down\\nSirgil unsheathed a concealed dagger and ran it deep into Valin's\\nstomach.</p>\\n<p>Eshmanin was shocked. Valin had been a loyal member of the guard and\\na good friend. He knew though, that war meant death. He watched as\\nValin sank to the ground in a pool of blood.</p>\\n<p>The mob behind Valin raised their weapons as Sirgil's army\\nslowly approached. The bloodshed was about to begin, and it was to be\\na horrible show of force. However, the armies within yards of each\\nother, a woman in her forties ran between them and fell to her knees.\\nEshmanin paused and looked at the woman. It was a baker from across\\ntown. She was a kind and loving woman, with many sons. She begged\\nSirgil for mercy, but none was to be had. Sirgil stabbed her in\\nthe shoulder and tossed her aside.</p>\\n<p>The armies came closer and closer to each other, but Eshmanin had\\ntopped. He looked at the girl on the ground bleeding. She looked back\\nat him with pain in her eyes. Eshmanin turned to see the bleeding\\nguard Valin on the ground. He then realized that the woman on the\\nground was Valin's mother.</p>\\n<p>Eshmanin turned to look at the loyalists at the steps of the\\nmayor mansion. Almost all of them were citizens. They stood no\\nchance against trained guards. These were the people of Dale. The people\\na king is supposed to protect. Sirgil wasn't in this to protect\\nthe people. The people didn't want this.</p>\\n<p>Eshmanin ran to the front of the army and stood in front of Sirgil.\\nWe can't do this, he said. Eshmanin started to begin his speech\\nabout the people, but had no time. Sirgil without a word went to stab\\nhim. This would prove to be a mistake. Eshmanin was not the brightest\\nof men, but he had seen many battles. His instinct kicked in, and\\nbefore anyone could see or say anything, he dodged Sirgil's knife\\nattack and cut the man with his sword.</p>\\n<p>Sirgil fell to the ground in a fit of pain. He held his organs in\\nwith great effort and looked past Eshmanin to the mansion before\\nhim. There, in the window stood Raymond the mayor. He was not the\\ncoward Sirgil had thought, for Raymond stood in the window a bow and\\narrow drawn ready to fight. Sirgil rolled over on the ground and looked\\nat his army. They had stopped moving. They looked on at him with pity\\nand disgust, not the reverence they once had. Finally, he laid on his\\nback and stared at the man Eshmanin, who had killed him. Eshmanin,\\nthe slow thinker so he had always believed, would now be the captain\\nof the guards. His head fell to the side, and there he seen Raymond in\\nthe window again. The fat man had lowered his bow and was\\nsmiling. Smiling!</p>\\n<p>Sirgil then sputtered, \\\"I will not see my city ruined by those unworthy\\nto own her!\\\" He stood up, to the great surprise of everyone and\\nstarted casting a spell. Eshmanin drew his sword to stop him, but was\\nnot quick enough. A huge flame settled upon the mayor's mansion and half\\na second later, Sirgil's head fell to the ground.</p>\\n<p>The fire spread quickly, and devoured the houses around it. The army\\nthat Sirgil once lead realized now their folly, and also realized\\nthat they too loved this city and had families they must protect.\\nThe revolting army and the loyal citizens quickly banded together\\nto smother the great fire, but it was of no use. Within hours, the\\nentire city was ablaze. Even with help from the dwarves to the north\\nand the multicultural city to the south, there was little they could\\ndo. They did successfully contain the fire with the walls, but the\\ninner town continued to burn.</p>\\n<p>And at the hands of the man sworn to protect it, destined to inherit\\nit, Dale died.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"The History of Dale\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"/books/historyofdale\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/books-historyofdale.json\n// module id = 693\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>My name is Eric Tolbar, and I am here to plead to your sense of\\nrationality. I will first tell you my story, but this is not just an\\nautobiography. It is a cry for reason, but I'll allow you to come to\\nthat conclusion yourself.</p>\\n<p>I was born in a stonewalled town of Maethelburg, about a score years ago\\nas the first and only son of Geven Tolbar. My sister, Sada, was to come two\\nyears later. She was the last of my father's offspring, as our mother died\\nduring her birth. I don't remember her well at all, save a fading memory\\nof a beautiful woman reading to me, as I laid curled next to her, my head in\\nher lap.</p>\\n<p>Now, for those who are not from Maethelburg, if you should find this\\ntext, let me give you some history, and insight into the town. During the\\nThird Age many men lived in western Mirkwood, and they formed their own\\nclans and the like, and controlled a small area. These woodmen were very\\nproficient in living off the forest, and did so for many, many years. At\\nan unknown point in time, these clans joined together, and built a small\\nwooden fort, on the Anduin, partially for trade, and partially for other\\nreasons. This fort was built by my ancestor, Galleth Tolbar, and named\\nMaethelburg.</p>\\n<p>Soon after, a renowned halfling, by the name of Frodo Baggins, succeeded\\nin his quest, and destroyed the One Ring. Immediately, the dark forest\\nMirkwood began to lighten, and the evil receded. It was at this time, the\\nwoodmen of the forest sought to expand their land, and their hold, on the\\ngreat forest, which was temporarily renamed Greenwood. Unfortunately,\\nthe Elves that occupied the area did as well.</p>\\n<p>And so as it so often happens in our world, greed led to fighting and\\nthen the fighting led to anger and distrust. As a result, the woodmen moved\\nout of the forest that made them prosper and built a great walled city\\naround their fort. Sadly, the inhabitants of Maethelburg still shun the Elven\\npeople.</p>\\n<p>My father is an architect, as was his father, and so on, back until the\\nday's of Galleth Tolbar, who built the wooden fort that is still standing\\ntoday. Some may not think it so, but architecture is an art, and a skill, and\\nmy father is one of best to ever live. When I was a young adolescent, my\\nfather began to teach me the ins and outs of the trade, but I quickly\\nbecame bored with the idea.</p>\\n<p>Now, Maethelburg is a very traditional place. Sons took over their\\nfather's trades, and change was frowned upon by most. However, my\\ngeneration began to look at things differently. As young adolescents we\\nbegan to form secret clubs, in which we snuck in poetry and literature from\\nfar away places, that we managed to obtain. Now, many people may find\\nthis to be odd, but you must remember, such things were taboo in my\\nland. We began to write our own stories and our own poems, and tell them\\nto each other. We learned so much during those years, and we grew wiser\\nthan our parents quickly, as they had no exposure to the cultures of lands\\nfar away, nor even cared for the finest of literature.</p>\\n<p>With education comes realization, and we realized that as we hid in the\\nshadows, a small group, nothing changed on the outside, so we decided\\nthat if Maethelburg was to become a city of enlightenment and freedom of\\nthought, then we would have to make these things public. So we did.\\nOf course this was taken as a sign of rebellion, which in a way it was.\\nFew would listen to us, but some did. Our group grew larger, and our\\ngatherings became more frequent. It was at this time I met the two people\\nwould change my life forever.</p>\\n<p>An Elf came to our town. Now, this wasn't totally unheard of, but it was\\nrare enough that it caused people to whisper about it. This Elf was\\ndifferent though. He walked through the cobblestone streets as if he owned\\nthem, unlike the others who crept through the town trying to remain\\ninconspicuous. He dressed flamboyantly, smiling at all whom he passed.\\nSomehow, he learned of one of our meetings, and there he introduced\\nhimself as Perthos, and he read some of the greatest poetry we had ever\\nheard. We stood and applauded him, and the things he had to say. It was\\na very joyous night indeed.</p>\\n<p>Perthos began to visit Maethelburg more and more often, annoying the\\ngrown men of our city who resented him not only for his heritage, but\\nalso his charisma. Others quickly took to him, myself and my sister\\nincluded. The three of us became very good friends, and upon Perthos's\\narrival into town, Sada and I could be seen running to greet him, and soon\\nthe three of us was to become the four.</p>\\n<p>One day, Perthos brought a companion with him. A man wearing all white,\\nsurrounded by a large white cloak, his face hidden behind a white hood.\\nHe carried with him nothing but a large staff, which he used as he walked.\\nWhen we asked Perthos to introduce himself to his friend, he quickly\\nchanged the subject, and the man remained quiet. Later that evening, we\\nhad a small gathering in the park, which was for original poetry. Many\\nmen stood and spoke powerful words, and finally the stranger asked if he\\ncould speak. We agreed, and he took to the podium and recited perfectly a\\nfamous poem. One young man stood up and denounced the stranger,\\nyelling \\\"Fool, this is for original art only. Do not recant other's\\nwork we all know that poem was written by a man named Arates.\\\" The\\nstranger nodded, and coyly replied, \\\"So I take it you've heard of me?\\\"</p>\\n<p>The crowd gasped in response as Perthos burst into laughter. He later\\ntold us he thought it would be amusing for us to meet the man whom's\\nworks we often discussed. Arates often came to our meetings and joined\\nin our philosophical debates, but rarely did he speak publicly.</p>\\n<p>By this time I had reached 16, and was very nearing 17. That is when my\\nfather, Geven, approached me, and said I should stop wasting my time\\nwith these foolish dreams and worthless philosophy, and come work with\\nhim. I was insulted, as I never had been before, to see my own father\\nrenounce my freewill and call all of my beliefs trash. We got into a\\nheated debate, and many things were said that I will not write of here. I\\nleft my home, infuriated, and decided to spend the evening in the park.\\nI sat there alone, watching the night sky, and contemplated what to do\\nwith my life. There were sounds about the night, none I was paying\\nattention to, until I heard Perthos voice rise high above the rest.\\nWhat he said, I cannot remember, but it caused me great alarm, and I ran\\nin the direction the shout come, and there, at the northern gate in the\\nwall, stood 3 guards, axes and swords drawn, facing Perthos, his rapier\\npoised for attack.</p>\\n<p>I quickly shouted, \\\"What is the meaning of this? What is going on here,\\\"\\nand for once my surname came in useful.</p>\\n<p>Perthos just glanced in my direction, his face trying to remain\\nexpressionless, but giving off obvious signs of remorse. He said nothing.\\nThe head guard spoke up, \\\"Eric! This Elf was caught attempting to\\nleave town, after assaulting your sister!\\\"</p>\\n<p>\\\"What!\\\" I screamed in disbelief, \\\"This man would never do anything to\\nharm Sada,\\\" and although I cannot say for sure, a part of my mind seems\\nto recall the sound of Perthos whispering \\\"So true\\\", accented by a tear\\nstriking the ground.</p>\\n<p>\\\"Sir, I swear it so,\\\" continued the Guardsman \\\"there was a shortened\\nscream coming from Miss Tolbar's room. When I went to investigate, I\\nseen him kneel by her, and she was crying. He looked me in the eye and\\nran, and I gave chase!\\\"</p>\\n<p>\\\"It's true, son,\\\" a dry, cold voice said, from the shadows. Slowly, my\\nfather stepped into the dim light of the lanterns. I was so confused, I\\nlooked up at Perthos and seen the tears in his eyes, and I wasn't sure\\nwhat to think.</p>\\n<p>His face formed a grimace, and, although he said it to all, he spoke to\\nme, when he cried \\\"Damn you all!\\\" and thrust his sword into the ground.\\nBefore anyone could react, Perthos had somehow, probably magically,\\nmanaged to scale the stone wall. He looked down on us, silhouetted in\\nthe dim light of the lanterns, and the glowing stars of the night sky,\\nand spoke,</p>\\n<p>\\\"I must say farewell<br />\\nfor it seems I am to fail.<br />\\nAnd because I am not your brother,<br />\\nI am forced to lose a love like none other.<br /></p>\\n<p>And I hope that you might<br />\\ncry throughout the night<br />\\nfor my heart has been slain,<br />\\nbecause you are so ruthless and vain.\\\"<br /></p>\\n<p>With that, he leapt from the wall, and I have yet to see him again. I\\nquickly ran home, to see my sister, ignoring the calls at my back for me\\nto wait. When I arrived, I see her sitting on the edge of her bed, her\\nnightgown soaked with tears. I approached to comfort her, and she cried\\nbriefly, then wiped the tears away.</p>\\n<p>I must tell you what happened, she sobbed, \\\"before they return.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In a vain attempt to comfort her, I responded, \\\"No, no, no,\\nyou've been through enough.\\\"</p>\\n<p>\\\"You don't understand,\\\" she cried and then she told me the truth, as I\\nhad never expected.</p>\\n<p>Perthos did enter her room that night, and she did scream in a panic.\\nShe was shocked to see an intruder, but quickly Perthos reassured her it\\nwas but him, and it was at that time he confessed his love for her. Not as a\\nfriend, he claimed, but as words could not explain. Sada was shocked,\\nand wasn't sure what to say, and before she could even smile, the head\\nguardsman and our father burst into the room, weapons raised. It was\\nthen Perthos had bolted through the window, to leave our lives forever.</p>\\n<p>I love my sister, and I have never held anything from her, or lied to\\nher in any way, and nor she to me. I knew what she said was true,\\nbecause it all clicked, like a puzzle you can't solve until someone finally\\nhands you the rest of pieces. I left that night, renouncing my heritage, and\\nforsaking the town of Maethelburg. I lived for years along the Anduin Valley,\\nsleeping in caves, and occasionally working for farmers in exchange\\nlodgings. I lived by my wits, and by my sword for years. I've recently\\nsettled in Vinyanost, a place which seems to tolerate those who are\\nsomewhat different. How long I will reside here, I do not know.</p>\\n<p>I haven't seen Perthos since that day, nor Sada, nor Arates. I fear all\\nthree of them hate me now, and I cannot blame them. I have not seen\\nGeven, the man I used to say was my father, but I can honestly say I care\\nnot what he thinks. I miss my friends, and I often wonder what I would say\\nto my sister, or to my mentor, Arates, if I see them again, but not as\\noften as I think about what would happen if I seen Perthos. Would I fall to\\nmy knees and beg him for forgiveness? Or would my inner rage erupt and\\ncause me to run him through for ripping apart my family, and hurting my\\nsister so much? I don't know. I can honestly tell you, I don't care to\\nfind out.</p>\\n<p>I write this for two reasons. The first is the most obvious, closure.</p>\\n<p>I'm not sure how effective this will be, but it may help, but the second is\\nthe most important. It is for you, the reader, to comprehend this text, and\\nto realize the misgivings of prejudice, and to realize that such things are\\nmore evil than the things that dwell in the depths of Mirkwood. I hope\\nsomeday to return to Maethelburg, and see that the city is now free of all\\nforms of hatred. Where the intellectuals and the labors laugh happily over a\\nbeer, and the Elves and the Humans can be see frolicking in the sun. Hope,\\nsometimes it's all a man has to live for.</p>\\n<p>Eric Tolbar.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"A Citizen without a City, and a City without Civility\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"/books/acitizenwithoutacity\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/books-acitizenwithoutacity.json\n// module id = 694\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>A tract by Westroth, scholar of Vinyanost.<br /></p>\\n<p>I have seen arguments before as to the proliferance of \\\"wraiths\\\" on our\\nplane, most notably that of my esteemed colleague Arates of Laketown.\\nWhile I agree on most of his points, there are several places in which, I\\nmust say, my point of view differs substantially.</p>\\n<p>In the first age, the first signs of the activity of Morgoth Bauglir were\\nthe unleashing of wraiths and spirits upon the Elves, who were set to roam\\nfree for the first time upon Middle Earth.

While I agree that fewer wraiths roamed the\\nworld in the third age, I believe that they were always there. The free\\npeoples had not the will to look for them.</p>\\n<p>I lack the talent myself to commonly see into the spirit world. I have, in\\nmy travels, caught glimpses of spirits and wraiths, yet my travelling\\ncompanions often reared back in horror as they struggled against an unseen\\nfoe, while I stood, impotent and helpless, just watching them.</p>\\n<p>On the basis of this, and numerous other sets of anecdotal evidence, I\\nbelieve it is not the spirit world that is returning, but instead the talent\\nto perceive spirits, long lost to the free peoples, is returning on a broader\\nscale. I take this as a gift from the Valar, preparing us for a time of need.\\nPerhaps it is their last gift. I know of no Istari wandering amongst the free\\npeoples in this age.</p>\\n<p>As further evidence to this, I have consulted the famous Red Book of\\nWestmarch. This recounts the histories of the Shire, and most notably, those\\nof the journeys of that great hero of the Shire, Frodo Baggins (praise him\\nwith great praise!). In this book, it is suggested that when Frodo wore the\\nOne Ring on Weathertop in the presence of those Wraiths most foul in the\\nThird Age, the Ringwraiths, Frodo \\\"entered\\\" the wraith plane, and was able to\\n\\\"physically\\\" attack the Ringwriaths, which were, at the time, non-corporeal\\nin form.</p>\\n<p>This is one of the first recorded accounts of the perception and \\\"mental\\\"\\nattack of the wraith form. The One Ring, truly a mighty device, allowed the\\nwearer to have a far greater perception of the spirit world wearing the item\\nthan if he were not. While perceiving the wraiths in their \\\"true\\\" form, Frodo\\ncould then attack them. Had he more willpower, he may have been able to\\nwithstand their assaults and defeat them.</p>\\n<p>In our age, their are also examples of such items, though, of course, on a\\nFAR lesser scale than the One Ring. I myself have worn a magnificent silver\\nnecklace which allowed me to see into the spirit world. How these devices\\nwork is the subject of further research.</p>\\n<p>In conclusion, spirits are manifestations of evil will loosed upon our world.\\nThough they have always existed, the combination of a greater perception of\\nthe spirit world and the swelling of spirits numbers have made it seem like\\na plague has been loosed upon us. Arates has argued against the overall\\ndecimation of the spirits, citing, as an example, a player of \\\"beautiful\\nmusic\\\".

That's right,\\nthis is my attempt to understand and explain the newly discovered\\nMystical Arts, and the Wriath-World, as I refer to it.</p>\\n<h4>THE WRAITH-WORLD.</h4>\\n<p>Shortly before the arrival of the Shadow that rests over the vast\\nmajority of Mirkwood, and the surrounding areas, strange creatures\\nbegan to appear in our land. Ghosts, if you will, although I perfer\\nto refer to them as Wraiths. It has been speculated in the past that\\nWraith's are the souls of beings who have died, and held something so\\nclosely to them that they cling to our place. I disagree, somewhat.\\nI have a belief of 3 planes: The Material World, which is what we live\\nin, The Mandos Realm, where the dead live, and The Shadow Plane, or\\nThe Wraith World.</p>\\n<p>The Mandos Realm is not completely unknown to us, it has been a belief\\nfor a long, long time now, that when a person dies, Mandos takes his\\nsoul and carries him to his Realm. My idea is that inbetween these\\ntwo realms, our world and his, lies the Wraith-World.</p>\\n<p>My philosophy is that The Wraith-World is a plane which is very close\\nto our own mortal lands, and the dead can leave Mandos and enter it,\\nto view and watch our world. They do this often, as the dead are greatly\\ninterested in mortal affairs, especially with the ones they left behind.</p>\\n<p>Some of these dead can stretch thier powers, and create an intangable\\nform on this plane. These are the spirits and wraiths we see so often.\\nI also feel that the dead hate the living, for we have so much more than\\nthey, and they resent us for it, this is why they are so often hostile\\nto us.</p>\\n<p>Also, it has been said, that some powerful creatures have the power to\\nsummon, create, or possibly even turn themselves into wraiths. I do\\nbelieve this is possible, as so much raw power rests in the Shadow Plane.</p>\\n<h4>SPIRIT BATTLE.</h4>\\n<p>Somewhere, somehow, one of these wraiths learn they could do us harm.\\nUsually they attack our mind, but also our pysical bodies, seemingly\\nfrom the inside. No scars are shown from these attacks, but the body\\nand mind are quickly weakened to an utterly feable state. Many have\\nbeen killed.</p>\\n<p>After a period in which many of these spirits were fightning mortals,\\npeople began to understand, partially, this attack. One must \\\"project\\\"\\nhis soul, temporarily, into this Wriath-World, where that spirit dwells.\\nThis will harm the wraith in a similar way to which they harm us. The\\nprojection into the Wraith-World is over so quickly, almost instantaneous,\\nfew even recognize what is happening, and just get this feeling of thier\\nmind and body pulling out, and suddenly pushing back in.</p>\\n<p>Soon, the spirits were subdued, most were too weak to survive the\\nonslaught of wraith-haters that soon went destroying every spectre\\nthey could precieve.</p>\\n<p>Some people began to form small religous cults based around these\\nwraith-haters, and thier teachings. That is why today some people\\nrefer to those who are well aware of the Wraith-World \\\"clerics.\\\"\\nMost people still use the common, and more accurate term, \\\"mystics.\\\"</p>\\n<h4>ENTERING THE WRAITH-WORLD.</h4>\\n<p>As people began to attack these wraiths, and spend these quick moments\\nin there land, they began to see and understand wraiths more, and better\\nprecieve them, and by that were able to cause greater harm to them. These\\npeople also began to establish a \\\"connection\\\" to this plane, and soon\\nsome learned that by using this connection, they could modify things\\nmuch like magic.</p>\\n<h4>MAGIC.</h4>\\n<p>After the War of the Ring, the magic once wielded by only the High\\nElves, Istari, and other so-called greater races, leaked into the\\nhands of the other races of Arda. Humans were the first to begin to\\nunderstand, and teach, and then the knowledge quickly spread to all\\nthe other races accross the Middle-Earth. Even today, some of the\\nmore powerful orcs and uruk-hai have learned these arts.</p>\\n<p>Mystical powers are similar in some ways to Magic, but not in all.\\nMystical Arts seem to take a different kind of toll on the user,\\nand his threshold is seemingly based on his contact with the\\nWraith-World. These powers are not yet an exact science, and no one\\nknows exactly how they work, yet. My personal belief is that with\\nthe knowledge of the wraith-world, some people can actually modify\\nreality, unknowningly, by using these powers. I myself am a user of\\nthese powers, but I highly discourage people to do so. They are not\\nwell understood and no one is quite sure how they work, we could be\\ncausing permanent damage to ourselves, our world, or even reality\\nitself. Although I may sound like a hypocrit, I do these things only\\nfor the sake of knowledge, and better understanding. Please, be weary.</p>\\n<h4>THE MURDER.</h4>\\n<p>Shortly after the purging of most spirits in our land by the religous\\nzealots, a man was convinced this was a wrong thing, as not all wraiths\\nwere hostile. This man confronted one of the self-proclaimed clerics,\\nand asked him to stop. They got in a heated arguement. The man suddenly,\\nand at first unknowingly, attacked the cleric through the spirit-plane.</p>\\n<p>The man quickly learned that he could attack other people much like\\nwraiths could attack him. It was easier on those that had been in\\nalot of contact with the plane, but it worked on almost everyone.</p>\\n<p>He went insane. For about 3 hours, he projected himself onto the\\nsurrounded community, filled with the religous zealots he hated so\\nmuch. He killed most, but was finally ran through by a young boy,\\nnone-the-less.</p>\\n<p>Word spread, other similar things happened, but people learned that\\nusually the sword was much stronger than the mind, in this case.</p>\\n<h4>THE SHADOW.</h4>\\n<p>This all began to happen, shortly before, and during the arrival\\nof the Shadow that lies above eastern Arda. The first appearence\\nof the Shadow was during the very same month that The Murder, and\\nits following tragedies happened. These people were the first of\\nthe Shadow's corruption.</p>\\n<p>What is the Shadow? No one knows, few care to speculate, many are\\nscared. This is what I think: the Shadow is a long dead minion of\\nSauron, or possibly, and most frighteningly, a hareld of Morgoth,\\nwho in death, is lying in the Shadow-Plane, a Wraith himself, using\\nhis powers to corrupt the Material World.</p>\\n<p>How do we stop it? That I cannot answer. I am but a scholar, and\\nsomewhat of a philosopher, writing this text to maybe help people\\nunderstand better what Wraiths are, and what to do about them.</p>\\n<p>Do I believe in Wraith-Genocide. No I don't. I was walking about\\none day, observing nature at its finest, and I heard a beautiful\\nmelody reach my ears. Atop a near hill, a spectre played a violin,\\nand it was one of the most beautiful compositions I have ever heard.</p>\\n<p>Think before you act, when what you do involves the Wraith-World,\\nfor the reprecussions may be greater than you can handle, or even\\ngreater than you can imagine.</p>\\n<p>-Arates, Scholar of Esgaroth.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"A Speculation on Spirits\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"/books/aspeculationonspirits\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/books-aspeculationonspirits.json\n// module id = 696\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>The sky was clear and blue, with the occasional cirrus for decoration.

Gunthar sighed, and dipped his\\nquill pen into an ink bottle, preparing to write a note for Kastlin, and leave\\nfor home. That was when the kid ran in. Short of breath, and scared out of his\\nmind, the young recruit shouted at his commander, \\\"The Uruk-Hai are outside.\\nHundreds of them.\\\" Gunthar quickly gathered all the men he had available, but by\\nthat time the enemy had already crossed the ford in the River Anduin and had\\nkilled off the men in his guard post. They were at the gate, and they numbered\\ntwice that of Vinyanost's men. Led by the great commander Radbug, the Uruks\\ncharged. Slaying man, elf, hobbit and dwarf alike, they only stopped to set fire\\nto the surrounding buildings. They fought their way through the gate, and into\\nthe town square.</p>\\n<p>They were careless, as uruk's are, and for every one of the free races of Arda,\\nthey killed, one of their own fell in battle, but they were still fierce and\\nstill grossly outnumbered the Vinyanost army. A young woman had stepped forward,\\nand began to infuse her wrath upon the Radbug's troops. Fire exploded amongst\\ntheir ranks, killing many instantly. Her name was Kara, and she had never killed\\nbefore today. Her magic continued to assail the uruks, when finally one of them\\nreached, and lifted his sword to behead the lady. Kara had no time to complete\\nher incantation to save her life. To her great surprise, a long stiletto\\nsuddenly found its way into the uruk's throat. Kastlin, recently returned,\\nyelled at her from behind \\\"Girl, get the hell out of here.\\\" She turned to face\\nthe small man, and sent an icy blast of wind in his general direction. Kastlin\\nbegan to move out of the way, until he realized her aim was off. Behind him, an\\nuruk fell to his death. Kara glared at Kastlin and said, \\\"Not a chance.\\\"The\\nscout paused, ran his gaze over the woman that stood before him, and said\\nsimply, \\\"Your brother would be proud.\\\" She just looked at him in response.\\nThe battle raged. Buildings and homes were raised by the seemingly never ending\\nonslaught of uruks.</p>\\n<p>Gunthar watched helplessly as his men fell to the ground before him. He fought\\nwith valor, his mentor, Randolph at his side, but nothing he did could stop the\\noncoming forces of the Shadow. Gunthar didn't notice Randolph had broken away\\nfrom the formation. The aging man battled his way to the leader of the opposing\\narmy, Radbug. Before Randolph even had a chance to engage the commander, Radbug\\nconnected his great warhammer with the former sword master's skull. Gunthar\\nscreamed as the man who had treated him like a son fell to the ground, faceless\\nand unrecognizable. Gunthar raised his sword and broke into a dead run. He\\ncharged a hatred so strong you could see it burning red in his eyes. His passion\\nwelled up in his heart, and at full momentum he charged the great uruk who had\\njust slain his life long friend, confidant, and teacher.</p>\\n<p>The Uruk-Hai may not be the smartest creatures around, but they know how to wage\\nwar. Radbug turned at the piercing yell of the human's great leader, turned his\\nhammer and parried the obvious attack of the human general. The uruk then swung\\nhis great hammer towards his attacker, crushing Gunthar's arm into a useless\\nheap. The general fell to the ground, hard. He looked up at his bane, who just\\ngrinned back, proud of his kill. Gunthar turned to the side, and winced at the\\noncoming death blow, but instead of having his head smashed in, he felt\\nsomething heavy fall hard into his lap. It was Radbug's head, fully detached\\nfrom his shoulders. There, above the uruk's corpse, axe in hand, stood Thog\\nBloodsbane.</p>\\n<p>Thog's massive frame stood above the fallen Gunthar. He nodded very\\nsolemnly. Gunthar nodded back. Thog looked at his former friend, and said \\\"I\\nnever intended it to go down like it did.\\\" Gunthar looked Bloodsbane in the\\neyes, and said \\\"I know.\\\" Thog then silently turn back to the battle. Gunthar\\ntried to stand, but couldn't. The same young man who had burst into his office\\nwhat seemed like years ago with the news of the imminent invasion came up to\\nGunthar, and dragged him through the western gate to the other side of\\nVinyanost.</p>\\n<p>Together, Gunthar and this boy, whose name was Ivan, watched their city\\nburn.Thog's men had caught the uruks from behind, demoralized by their leader's\\ndeath and trapped between two factions, the uruks began to die and flee. Thog\\nand his men chased after them, leaving behind the giant fireball they long ago\\nthey had called home. Many hours after the fight, the fires finally came down.\\nAlthough the men of Vinyanost had one the battle, their home was in ruined,\\nunsalavagable. Gunthar walked through the ashes of his town, trying not to look\\ndown at the faces he new all too well. Until he reached one. He knelt down by\\nthe corpse of Randolph Huxley, thanked him for everything he had done, and\\ncried. Ivan walked behind him, and spoke, \\\"Sir, you have to go. You're going to\\ndie too if you don't get someone to do something about your arm. Gunthar's head\\nsnapped up, and he yelled at the boy, \\\"Maybe I want to die! Everything I've ever\\nhad is gone, lost, everything that I've ever stood for, burned or slain. Maybe I\\ndeserve to die-\\\" Ivan cut him off with a single statement, \\\"Maybe Mr. Huxley\\nwouldn't want you to die.\\\" Gunthar stopped, stared at the corpse of his great\\nfriend and advisor and said, \\\"Take me to a doctor.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Ivan did so, and along with everything else, Gunthar lost his arm. He never did\\nreturn back to Vinyanost... it hurt too much, but Ivan did. He returned once,\\nand only once, and retrieved something.

It's position is directly on the Anduin, which would open up some trading with the Southern regions while be very close to the woods in which these clans lived. It also helped protect from any forces of aggressive nature attacking the woodmen villages on the western border of Mirkwood such as orcs from the misties, wargs, wolves, and other groups of humans (it was not needed in the woods, for the woodmen could hold their own in nearly any woodland battle). It was quite small, but effective. </p>\\n<p>After the war, Mirkwood was nearly as devoid of evil as it was in the past. But with the whole forest for the taking, both the woodmen and the sylvan elves wanted to broaden their land. Conflicts arose with between the same woodmen clans that built Maethelburg and the wood elves (for the clans lived around the forest gate and elf-path).

Seeing as if they didn't retreat to somewhere, they would die, the woodmen decided to leave their beloved forest. The only suitable place for living would be a spot on the great nearby river with protection. This place, therefore, would be chosen to be the already built fort of Maethelburg. But since the size of Maethelburg wasn't near large enough to house all of these woodmen, who had since united their diminishing numbers (trolls and spiders are very hungry creatures), an outer city was added on.

The Shadow does not wish to be revealed, its time is not ripe. It strongly resists any attempt to expose it.</p>\\n<p>My account begins back in the Third Age, at the time of the War of the Ring. The great, and most renowned battles were fought by the valiant men of Gondor and Rohan, on the fields of Pellenor and before the great gates of Mordor itself. But that was not the extent of the war! For Sauron's arm was long, and his power mighty! Indeed, his foul minions swarmed out of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood, and from the Grey Mountain Narrows and Mount Gundabad to the north, and his hordes of Easterlings, seduced by promises of power, rode at his word out of their homes in Khand, sweeping through the mighty plains of Dorwinion. Even the Harads, from far to the south, were brought here in force, to assail the free peoples. But the might of the combined armies of the men of Laketown and Dale, the dwarves of Erebor and the Iron Hills under Dain, and the woodelves of Mirkwood, under Thranduil their King, fought valiantly, holding the north and crushing the might of Saurons army, holding out until the Ringbearer completed his task. Even the High Elves of Lorien were forced to defend the passes to their land, against a mighty assault from Dol Guldur. Thus enraged, and stirred into action, the high elves displayed their true might after the ring was destroyed, a force under Celeborn sweeping through Southern Mirkwood, and bringing down the walls of Dol Guldur itself. Under the influence of Thranduil in the north and Celeborn in the south, Mirkwood became again, for a time, Greenwood the Great, the fairest and greatest forest in all of Northern Arda.</p>\\n<p>Greenwood was divided, the southern half, up to the Mountains of Mirkwood, under the control of Celeborn and the high elves, and north of the mountains and the Old Forest Road to Thranduil and his wood-elves. Greenwood prospered, the Old Forest Road was restored, and trade flourished between the now mighty cities of men, Dale and Laketown, and the dwarven homes in the east and Imladris, and the newly developing regions in the old Dunedain kingdom in the Northwest, passing along the Old Forest Road and through the passes of the Misty Mountains.</p>\\n<p>Vinyanost was established in this time, an important link in the chain of trade, first as a camp spot after the Old Ford at the Anduin, and later developing into a thriving trade centre itself. Maethelburg spurung up also in this time, near the other great crossing of the Anduin.</p>\\n<p>But what of Saurons armies? They were not, of course, utterly destroyed in the War of the Ring, nor in the brutal aftermath, when the elves diplayed the power that remained to them in Middle Earth. The Easterlings, mostly, returned to their homelands in Khand, crushed and broken. A large number, however, sought refuge in Rhovanion, finding the broad and open plains to their liking, living on raids and what plunder they could find. The Harads also, far from their homeland, and blocked from returning easily by the new might of King Elessar's armies returning to settle Ithilien, sought refuge in Rhovanion, Khand, and wherever they could find land to live in.</p>\\n<p>Of Saurons mighty forces of Uruks, orcs, fearsome olog-hai, and trolls, it is hard to characterise the movements. The Olog-hai, mighty trolls that could withstand sunlight, quickly died out. They required the evil breeding methods Sauron had developed to procreate. The curse on Arda is best lost, and forgotten. The uruks and orcs fled, and dispersed, losing what was holding them together, fell to in-fighting. The sought refuge with the wild orcs of the Grey Mountains, and in Mount Gundabad and the other orcish strongholds in the Witch Kings former realm. They also fled to Moria and the Misties. The orcs and goblins plaguing the High Pass were destroyed, their numbers decimated as they were hunted down by the men settling in the North West, as they straddled the trade route between Erebor and Rivendell. The Grey Mountain Orcs ha ve withstood innumerable assaults from the dwarves, who seek the rich minerals of those mountains. Their numbers are few.</p>\\n<p>The uruks of Angband formed a loose coalition, and sought to express their power on the \\\"maggots\\\" who took \\\"their world\\\" from them. Raids were conducted on the trade routes. In this time, the cities of Maethelburg and Vinyanost became more fortified, to withstand these assaults.</p>\\n<p>In this time also, the powers of the high elves were waining in Arda. Many felt again, the call of the sea, and could not resist, setting out on their last journey, sailing the straight path. The powers of the high elves on Southern Mirkwood were weakening also with this departure. Bands of uruks, cut off from Angbar after raids, settled in the dark forest, finding areas much to their liking and caves in which to make their homes. The Old Forest Road, though for a long time safe, began to be perilous again.</p>\\n<p>At last, the hand of the Dunedain of the North and its young kingdom was forced. Angbar was assaulted by an army of men, and the elves remaining in Rivendell. Again, the uruks, crushed by this unexpected and mighty show of force, dispersed through the mountains. Many fled into Southern Mirkwood, swelling the numbers there.</p>\\n<p>In this time the Shadow began to rise. The orcs, leaderless and lost, grouped up and found direction. They became a force to be reckoned with in Southern Mirkwood, always on the move so no army could crush them, always striking in numbers at the merchant caravans on the Old Forest Road so no force could resist them. Greenwood again became Mirkwood.</p>\\n<p>I see the influence of the Shadow in this. The Harads and Easterlings of Rhovanion, long settled and quiet, begin to stir again at the call of some long forgotten master. The powers of the uruks, long thought to be dwindling appear renewed.</p>\\n<p>Now is the time to band together. We must find the shadow now, and crush it before it is too late. If the White Council had crushed Dol Guldur when the Necromancer first emerged, would so much heartache in the War of the Ring been averted?</p>\\n<p>We must find the Shadow. Doom awaits us if we fail.</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"The History of Vinyanost\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"/books/historyofvinyanost\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/books-historyofvinyanost.json\n// module id = 699\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<ol>\\n<li>\\\"Grizshask, the Half-Orc Chieftain\\\"</li>\\n<li>\\\"The Legend of Lake Guldulin\\\"</li>\\n<li>\\\"The Valley of the Golden Beech\\\"</li>\\n<li>\\\"Valley of the Stone Giants\\\"</li>\\n<li>\\\"The Old Forest Road through Eastern Mirkwood\\\"</li>\\n<li>\\\"The Cloth Industry of Dale\\\"</li>\\n<li>\\\"Farmers of the Laketown Plains\\\"</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>\\\"The Fortress of Angmacar\\\"</p>\\n<pre>\\n+----------------------------------+\\n|- \\\" * * * * * * * * * * * \\\" \\\" \\\" ^ |\\n|- \\\" * * * * * * * * * * * \\\" 6 \\\" - |\\n|- \\\" * * * * * * * * * * * \\\" 7 - - |\\n|- \\\" * * * * * * * * * * * - - + - |\\n|- \\\" * * * * * * * * * * * \\\" \\\" - \\\" |\\n|- \\\" \\\" * * * * * * ^ ^ * * * \\\" - \\\" |\\n|- \\\" \\\" * * ^ ^ ^ 4 ^ ^ ^ * * \\\" - \\\" |\\n|- \\\" \\\" * * 1 1 * 4 ^ ^ * * * * - \\\" |\\n|- \\\" \\\" * * * 2 3 ^ ^ ^ * * * * - \\\" |\\n|- - - - - - - - - - - - 5 5 - + \\\" |\\n|- \\\" \\\" * * * * * * * * * * * * 8 * |\\n|- \\\" \\\" * * * * * * - - * * * * - * |\\n|- \\\" \\\" * * * * * * * * * * * * - - |\\n+----------------------------------+\\n</pre>\\n<p>Aeglos, Sage and Scribe of Loth Lanath.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ol>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"Atlas of Mirkwood, Volume I: The Grey Series\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"/books/atlasofmirkwoodvi\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/books-atlasofmirkwoodvi.json\n// module id = 700\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>   The history of this valley is best told through a simple narrative.

The enchantment by the master\\nkeeps me from aging and dying, and that is perhaps the cruelest gift one can\\ngive another in a place like this. I call it a gift but it was in fact\\npunishment for my failure and my greatest sin: mercy. I never did have the\\nlust for inflicting pain as Vaz does. Vaz...the other apprentice to our\\nmaster. In our lives before this eternal entrapment he was the cruelest man I\\nhad ever known. </p>\\n<p>In the thousands of years since I have had the pleasure to\\nwitness the inception, manifestation, and dominance of complete insanity in my\\nassociate. Ive known madmen, but the slow transformation over centuries is\\nsomething much, much more. He may have the body of a man but his mind is\\ntwisted and corrupted. He takes a wicked delight in hearing his victims beg\\nfor mercy, to offer them a false hope and smash that hope as he smashes their\\nskulls open, and then laugh and laugh and laugh... Sometimes I hear their\\nscreams at night, as I awaken and I realize they are in fact my screams. </p>\\n<p>I\\nhave tried to escape, even though I know it is impossible. An enchantment to\\nhalt the aging process also affects my mind. I cant leave this place. Ive\\ngotten within a few feet of the door, but I collapse to the ground. Its a\\ncurious thing to have no control over your body and actions. Vaz has me do his\\nwork on occasion. He knows it makes me sick. I can feel their blood spread\\nover my hands as I slice into their flesh. As much as I try to stop, I have no\\npower. I pity my victim, but I too am the victim, and the recipient of\\ntorture. I once told Vaz that the screams his torture creates were too much\\nfor me to bear. He cut off my ears. I told him I couldnt stand the sight of\\nblood. He sliced out my eyes with a spoon. Im glad. Darkness is so less\\npainful. Yet as much as I try I cannot get him to end my life. I am his\\ngreatest experiment and most cherished amusement. He feeds off despair. I\\nsuppose I am a wellspring of it. However, Vaz is not what I fear the most. It\\nis the masters wrath that is unmatched. While Vaz can inflict pain and\\nsuffering he is but a man, and his skills are limited as such. </p>\\n<p>The master has\\npowers beyond any I can imagine, and the creativity to use those powers in\\nways I dare not imagine. But while Vaz is driven by his insanity, the master\\nis much more intelligent and calculated in his approach. These years have had\\nlittle affect on him, for he sleeps. He sleeps for centuries without waking.\\nUnlike Vaz, he was not a cruel man. He wanted power (dont we all), and had the\\nmeans to acquire that power. That is what drew me to him. When Vaz got out of\\ncontrol I wish the master had stopped him, but by then he had stopped caring\\nabout anything but his unending task: the guarding of his treasure. This\\ntemple was built for the sole reason of protecting it. And so he has for more\\nthan 3,000 years. Do not go near his treasure. He will sense it, and he will\\nawaken. If you are reading this, the only advice I can give you is to get\\nout...and never return. Count yourself lucky you can do so. If Vaz captures\\nyou, hope for a quick death. He sometimes grants that to the weary travelers\\nhe catches. Quick and painful, but quick. </p>\\n<p>If you try to take the masters\\ntreasure I can only see one result: an unending agonizing existence, such as I\\nhave had. For my own part, I have written what I can. I feel I have finally\\nfound a way to end my life. I find that if I can empty my mind of all violent\\nthoughts I may be able to use a seemingly non-lethal way to kill myself. I\\nhope I succeed.

of the Rules:</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>No Multiplaying. Only play one character at a time.</li>\\n<li>No same-side player-killing. See below for evil race exceptions.</li>\\n<li>No communication or cooperation across sides. Taunting in the game is ok.</li>\\n<li>\\n<p>Observe \\\"The Twenty Minute Rule:\\\"</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Wait 20 minutes before switching characters across sides. </li>\\n<li>Wait 5 minutes before switching characters on the same side.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>No Equipment Transfer between your own characters.\\nNo mules, please.</li>\\n<li>No abuse of bugs in the game system. Just report any bugs.</li>\\n<li>No reimbursement of anything lost due to bugs in the game system.</li>\\n<li>No character trading. Make and keep your own characters.</li>\\n<li>Respect role-playing. Respect those who are trying to have fun\\nby role-playing their characters.</li>\\n<li>No lying to high immortals (Valar, Arata, or Implementors)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>The Rules Explained:</h3>\\n<p>Everyone has more fun if everyone plays by the rules. Penalties for\\nrulebreaking range from loss of levels, to character deletion, to\\nbanning you from the game entirely.</p>\\n<p>In our game there are three player factions at war with each other.\\nThe term \\\"Whities\\\" refers to the Human, Dwarf, Wood Elf, Hobbit and\\nHigh Elf races. The term \\\"Darkies\\\" refers to the Uruk-Hai, Orc and\\nHaradrim races. \\\"Third side\\\" refers to the Uruk-Lhuth and Easterling\\nraces. </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>No Multiplaying. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>No multiplaying will be tolerated. You cannot have more then one MUD\\ncharacter on at any time.  Linkless players count for multiplaying\\n-- to enter one character you must RENT the other (if needed,\\nreconnect and rent).  You may own more than one character on the\\nmud, but you must follow the switching character rule to change characters. </p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>No same-side player-killing on the side of good.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Race-war Pkilling:  This involves killing players on opposite\\n\\\"sides\\\" of the game as you.  You will see these players' races only,\\nfor example, '<em>a Hobbit</em>' or '<em>an Uruk</em>'.  See 'HELP RACE WAR' for\\ndetails.</p>\\n<p>Whitie-whitie Pkilling:  Player killing on the same side as you is\\nanother matter entirely.  When you attack a player on the same side\\nas you, you will get a flag called 'rage'.  This flag prohibits you\\nfrom seeing where players of your side are in your area, for five\\n(5) minutes.  If you are below level 10, and you are a Whitie, you\\ncannot hit another Whitie, unless that Whitie has the rage flag.\\nAttacking another character on the whitie side on purpose is disallowed.</p>\\n<p>Same side pkill for evil races: Pkilling of other characters on the\\nsame side is allowed for evil races.  However, the killer is considered\\navenged after one kill, so repetative killing of the same character will\\nnot be tolerated, and the offender will be punished.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>No communication across sides.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>See 'HELP RACE WAR'.</p>\\n<p>Anyone caught giving information to other sides of the race war, be\\nit useful or not, will be dealt with in the strictest manner\\npossible.  This includes giving it over ICQ, AOL Instant Messenger,\\nE-mail, phones, or paper airplanes if you feel so inclined.\\nThis includes intentionally behaving in such a way that characters\\nof people you know OOC will not be harmed.\\nTaunting and antagonizing the enemy is not only quite acceptable, it\\nis the only allowable communication between sides.</p>\\n<p>Obviously, we cannot monitor your activities.  We ask that you act\\nin the best interests of the MUD and keep your information to your\\nside.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Observe the \\\"Twenty Minute Rule\\\"</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>You must wait 20 minutes before switching characters across sides.\\nYou must wait five minutes before switching characters on the same\\nside. Keep in mind that this amount of time is time spent rented\\n-out of the game-, NOT time spent at the rent room, NOT time\\nspend in the starting room, and NOT linkless.</p>\\n<p>These rules also apply to characters of different people playing\\nfrom the same computer.  For example, if you are playing a\\ncharacter, and you rent so that your brother can play, he and you\\nMUST observe the rules.</p>\\n<p>If you do not understand this, ASK AN IMMORTAL.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>No abuse of bugs in the game system.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If you find a bug in the game, post it, or tell an immortal (see\\n\\\"wizlist\\\") right away, especially if the bug could be used to a\\nplayer's advantage. If you are caught abusing a bug for your own\\ngood, you'll get in trouble, especially if you did not report it.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>No reimbursement of anything lost due to bugs in the game system.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>No reimbursements will be given out. While the game is imperfect,\\nand your character may sometimes suffer \\\"unfairly\\\", there will be no\\ncompensation of any kind either for the game rough edges or for\\nreal-life problems beyond our control.  Exception: when a\\nreimbursement is declared on the news board, the post will supercede\\nthis rule.</p>\\n<p>This is especially true for deaths or losses due to network or\\ninternet \\\"lag\\\" or timeouts.  If there is a timeout at the MUD end of\\nthings, all players will have no access to the MUD.  In this case,\\nan exception (see above) may be made.  In all other cases, we can't\\nbe held responsible.</p>\\n<p>If a reimbursement posting is made and subsequently removed, the\\nexcuse \\\"I didn't read the news\\\" will not be acceptable.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>No Equipment Transfer between your own characters.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>If you own several characters, you may not transfer objects or gold\\nfrom one character to another that you own, directly or indirectly.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>No character trading.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>No character trading is allowed.  This includes selling characters,\\nleaving characters with very obvious passwords, trading characters\\nfor Magic cards, and the like.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Respect role-playing. </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Some people like to fully act out their characters as they would be\\nin a good story, as opposed to playing the mud as if it were a simple\\nvideo game. This mud encourages such role-playing as it can be great\\nfun. Don't wreck the game for role-players.</p>\\n<p>The rules are simple. Don't try to stretch them or find loopholes.\\nThey do not exist not to make life harder for you, but rather to\\nkeep it enjoyable for the you and other players of the game. Please\\nhelp us make this a nice place to play by following the rules.</p>\"}}]}},\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/docs.json\n// module id = 724\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"pathContext\":{}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/getting-started.json\n// module id = 725\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"allMarkdownRemark\":{\"edges\":[{\"node\":{\"id\":\"C:/Users/slyon/Documents/GitHub/rots-site/src/pages/news/001670.md absPath of file >>> MarkdownRemark\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"News 1670\",\"date\":\"May 24, 2018\",\"path\":\"/news/1670\",\"desc\":\"5-24-2018 World/New Race Update\",\"author\":\"Lowtheim\"},\"excerpt\":\"   All mobs and scripts in game have been updated to accommodate the new\\nraces.
