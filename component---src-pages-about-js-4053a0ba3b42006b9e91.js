MUD is short for Multi-User Dimension (or Multi-User Dungeon); an online world, where almost anything is possible. A MUD contains players (other people online playing the game) and mobs (computer controlled creatures in the game that the players interact with). The game is a text-based adventure, where the player roams the world by reading text that describes each room, the mobs and objects in the room and the exits to and from the room. In this way, no graphics are seen, and how the world appears is all up to the imagination and interpretation of the player."),l.default.createElement("p",null,"In most MUDs, players can interact with each other by a system of commands. These commands are all basic, usually consisting of every-day things. Players can chat, (send a message to all of the players in the game with the chat channel on) narrate, (same as chat, but usually in-character information), sing (sing a song), tell (send a private message to a player) or say (send a message to everyone in the character's room). Other commands, including directional commands, are essential. These directional commands are n (north), e (east), s (south) and w (west).
