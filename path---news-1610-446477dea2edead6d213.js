A dwarven caravan\nleaves from the ranger camp west of Vinyanost and a goblin caravan has been\nspotted leaving the hills to the north.</p>\n<p>OOC:  This zone is based on the Icebay of Forochel at the northern\nend of the Misty Mountains.  <a href="http://www.tuckborough.net/lands.html">http://www.tuckborough.net/lands.html</a> is\na good site if you\'re interested in some history.

Mechanics are in place to ensure this does not happen, but as\nwe have seen in the past resourceful RoTS players have tried to find\nways to go around mechanics.  Anyone caught with the axe or following\ndwarves out of the zone will be punished HARSHLY.
