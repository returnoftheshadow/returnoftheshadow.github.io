No longer will you be able to duplicate the\nrewards (and simultaneously ruin the quest for the rest of the day) without\nkilling the Kraken properly. Feel free to idle in the chest room as long as\nyou please, but you will not be rewarded without killing the Kraken. :)</p>\n<p>The Angmacar/Gulduin quest has been altered slightly, particularly the\nportion involving the Summoner. Enjoy.</p>\n<p>Ferocious wargs no longer give ridiculous xp. They still give rather nice\nxp, just not the previous insane amount. My apologies to all of you who like\nto spam level on them. :P</p>\n<p>The Noldorin weapons have seen a slight depowering, but are once again\nobtainable. It is rumored that there may be a way for the forces of the\nShadow to obtain weapons of similar power, albiet in a completely different\nmanner.</p>\n<p>The dragon-toothed whip and quicksilver rapier have been altered. You will</p>\n<p>need to trade in any current items if you wish to gain the benefits of the\nupdate. Since they proved themselves so adept at handling the crescent axe\nchanges, I have assigned Karugh and Thrain to deal with the exchange\nprocess.</p>\n<p>The old green cloak has also been improved slightly. This is not a retro-\nactive change, and will apply only to new cloaks obtained.</p>\n<p>Items butchered from the corpses of fell beasts are now a little less\npainful to use.</p>\n<p>The Uruk Assassin, lured by the generous purse of the Emmisary of Dol\nGuldur, has abandoned Ungorod for the fortress captained by Karugh. The\nUruk Chieftan, furious at yet another desertion, has ordered his few\nremaining forces to do a better job of patroling vital areas.</p>\n<p>The plants of Arda that possess healing capabilities will now be slightly\nmore effective. The elvish rangers currently studying the strange tubor\nhave procured mounts to keep at the ready in the nearby stables.</p>\n<p>Jaiden has not been seen in some time. It is not known whether his fate has</p>\n<p>finally caught up with him, or if he has simply found a very good hiding\nplace. Either way, do not expect to encounter him for the time being.</p>\n<p>Enjoy.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1472: Additional Changes",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/news/1472"}}}});
