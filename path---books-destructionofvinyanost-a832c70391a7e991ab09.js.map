A young woman had stepped forward,\\nand began to infuse her wrath upon the Radbug's troops. Fire exploded amongst\\ntheir ranks, killing many instantly. Her name was Kara, and she had never killed\\nbefore today. Her magic continued to assail the uruks, when finally one of them\\nreached, and lifted his sword to behead the lady.

He fought\\nwith valor, his mentor, Randolph at his side, but nothing he did could stop the\\noncoming forces of the Shadow. Gunthar didn't notice Randolph had broken away\\nfrom the formation. The aging man battled his way to the leader of the opposing\\narmy, Radbug. Before Randolph even had a chance to engage the commander, Radbug\\nconnected his great warhammer with the former sword master's skull. Gunthar\\nscreamed as the man who had treated him like a son fell to the ground, faceless\\nand unrecognizable. Gunthar raised his sword and broke into a dead run.

The uruk then swung\\nhis great hammer towards his attacker, crushing Gunthar's arm into a useless\\nheap. The general fell to the ground, hard. He looked up at his bane, who just\\ngrinned back, proud of his kill. Gunthar turned to the side, and winced at the\\noncoming death blow, but instead of having his head smashed in, he felt\\nsomething heavy fall hard into his lap. It was Radbug's head, fully detached\\nfrom his shoulders. There, above the uruk's corpse, axe in hand, stood Thog\\nBloodsbane.</p>\\n<p>Thog's massive frame stood above the fallen Gunthar. He nodded very\\nsolemnly. Gunthar nodded back. Thog looked at his former friend, and said \\\"I\\nnever intended it to go down like it did.\\\" Gunthar looked Bloodsbane in the\\neyes, and said \\\"I know.\\\" Thog then silently turn back to the battle. Gunthar\\ntried to stand, but couldn't.
