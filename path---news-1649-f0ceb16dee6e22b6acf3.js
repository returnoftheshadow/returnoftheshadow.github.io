Far to the north a darkness is spreading from the depths of\nthe mountain fortress of Gundabad. A terrible entity has begun to exert its\nwill on the surrounding area. After the Dark Lord was destroyed it was\nterribly wounded, a tattered spirit held together only with hate. It found\nrefuge in cold blackness of Gundabad. After decades, it has regained a\nfraction of its' former power and its shadowy tendrils have begun to spread\nthroughout Gundabad, animating former guardians long forgotten.</p>\n<p>OOC: Gundabad is live!  Credit goes to:\nAzriya for the idea, map, and descriptions.\nAzriya and Faewen for designing the items.\nExtra thanks in general to Faewen for item balancing in general, because I'm terrible at it.\nI guess myself for the mobs, scripting, and some descriptions.\nLastly, the players for testing it out during the contest,\nLego specifically for leading several groups and\nhelping me find bugs.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1649: Gundabad - Jan 2017",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/news/1649"}}}});
