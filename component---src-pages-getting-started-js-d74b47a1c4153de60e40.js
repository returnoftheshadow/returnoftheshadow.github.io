Where do I get money and buy things?")),l.default.createElement("p",null,"A2. Money is fairly difficult to come by in ROTS, at first. Each character starts with enough money to buy some basic things such as a waterskin and some cotton clothes. There are a number of weak enemies nearby that may have money. There are things to look when finding a creature with cash. The main thing to look for is whether or not the enemy is humanoid. The killing of good people is generally frowned upon by other players and guards will not stand for it and attack you. But the killing of thieves, brigands, and other miscreants will go by unpunished."),l.default.createElement("p",null,l.default.createElement("strong",null,"Q3.  Where do I practice my skills and spells?")),l.default.createElement("p",null,'A3. There are teachers spread across Arda, hidden in towns, forests, and other areas. Many are open and easy to find, it\'s best to ask another player where a guildmaster may be found. Teachers usually specialize in a specific type of abilities and spells and seldom learn others. To see the sort of spells you can learn type "MAN SPELL LIST" To see the mystical powers that maybe learned type "MAN POWER LIST" To see the skills that one may practice type "MAN SKILL LIST". When at a guildmaster type "Practice" to see a list of the skills and spells that may be learned. Type "Practice ',"<","skill",">",'" and you will spend one practic e session on that skill.'),l.default.createElement("p",null,l.default.createElement("strong",null,'Q4.  Where is it safe to xp "get experience"?')),l.default.createElement("p",null,'A4. Experience plays a vital role in how the game works.  There are a number creatures found everywhere on Arda. The generally safe areas to gain experienceare near towns and in wide open areas.  Remember to type "consider ',"<","target",">",'" to see a creatures strength and level compared to yours. Keep an eye on your health level and "flee" when it drops low, "Wounded" is generally a safe time to flee so that leaves leeway for failed attempts. Keep in mind that consider can be decieving as to the actual strength of an opponent. Generally farms that support life are a great place to sharpen ones skill and butcher food "Butcher ',"<","target",">",'" for one to eat. Remember dark areas are not usually a good place to be without a light, there are spells that allow you to create lights and see in the dark, and torches and other lights can be purchased in various dry goods shops in each city.'),l.default.createElement("p",null,l.default.createElement("strong",null,"Q5.  How does PKILLING work here?")),l.default.createElement("p",null,'A5. PKilling is possibly one of the most important things involved in the game, but pkill must not be stepped upon with a light touch. Good Race vs. Good Race is not allowed and any member of a "good" race who is caught attacking another member of the "good" race will be dealt with harshly. On the other hand, there is the other side of the war, two other groups of players that play the game. These are the Orcs and Uruk-hai and the Third Side, the Magi, or Uruk-Lhuth, These players will pkill each other and will pkill the Good Races for fame and equipment. This is a major factor in the game. As a beginner you should avoid encountering these races but when you are a mature character and have experience in the game and its commands you may find yourself to be a very good PKer. Keep in mind Pkilling is a preference and is not a required part of the game.'),l.default.createElement("p",null,l.default.createElement("strong",null,"Q6.  How do I get the gates of a city open?")),l.default.createElement("p",null,'A6.  There are a number of ways for a person to open a gate. First if you are in a city you may attempt to open the gate or if that does not work "say open" near a gatekeeper and he will open the door or gate that he is posted to. If you are on the other side of a door or gate that has a gatekeeper try knocking on the gate or door and the gatekeeper may open it.'),l.default.createElement("p",null,l.default.createElement("strong",null,"Q7.  Other sources of information?")),l.default.createElement("p",null,'A7.  The game has a built-in manual that uses a ladder/topic system. To open the manual type "MANUAL" and the proceed with "MANUAL ',"<","CHAPTER",">"," ","<","TOPIC",">",'". (see help Manual) The game also maintains a news system that can be read anywhere. "NEWS" will bring up a list of the current news topics.  "News',"<","topic #",">",' will bring up that specific news article. There are also bulletin boards for mortal news, and in-character topics, stationed throughout the towns, to use the board system "look board" and then "read board ',"<","topic #",">","."),l.default.createElement("p",null,l.default.createElement("strong",null,"Q8.   What are some of the more useful commands we may use on here?")),l.default.createElement("p",null,'A8.  A list of the various commands can be seen by typing "commands". Further help on each command can be gained by typing "help ',"<","command",">",'".  Some of the more useful commands that you will want to read about are: Alias, assist, butcher, compare, equipment, flee, inventory, rent, quit, rest,score, info, set, sleep, where, and who. These are commands you will find yourself using quite often during your travels through Arda so it is best to get familiar with them as quickly as possible.'),l.default.createElement("p",null,l.default.createElement("strong",null,"Q9.  Why won't some people help me?")),l.default.createElement("p",null,"A9. While it is generally nice to help people, there is no law that dictates that higher levels should help newibes. Certain people have a belief system that says that they shouldn't help newbies, others dont concern themselves with it. As a newbie, it is important to realize that higher levels may or may not help you with equipment or gold - its their choice. Usually, if anyone feels like giving out some equipment or gold, they will give it freely. Begging is highly disliked and if you plan on getting along with others, do NOT beg."),l.default.createElement("p",null,l.default.createElement("strong",null,"Q10. What is spam?")),l.default.createElement("p",null,'A10. Spam is generally considered the repetition of some action that causes someones screen to be full of useless information. If someone accuses you of "spamming" them, it means that your constant yelling/narrating/shouting/ etc. has made them unable to do anything. As you might have already guessed, spamming is frowned upon by management.')))},e.exports=t.default},1009:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a.p+"static/ask_equipment.1ee0d60b.jpg"}});
