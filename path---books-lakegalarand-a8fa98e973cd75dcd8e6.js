The lake and associated wetlands have formed as a result of natural\nrunoff into a large basin. The basin-depression possesses a discrete western\nmargin which takes the form of a strong and distinct ridge. The old elven\npathway, known as Mor Erlond takes advantage of this terrain feature and\nfollows the ridge diligently. The northern and southern margins of Lake\nGalarand are less distinct and great swampy wetlands sprawl outwards. Seasonal\nchanges in rainfall patterns dictate the extend of the actual lake and the\nsurrounding wetlands. There is very little evidence of humanoid activity in\nthis area. The swamps are particularly unpleasant and unhospitable and have\nresisted the majority of attempts by woodsmen to settle alongside the banks in\norder to take advantage of the plentiful fish stocks within the lake.</p>\n<p>Aeglos, Sage and Scribe of Loth Lanath.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Lake Galarand"}}},pathContext:{path:"/books/lakegalarand"}}}});
