The ditchs in places have\npartially collapsed  but the thick hedges and the dense packing of the trees\nprovide suitable alternative protection to these hidden structures. The fauna\nin this area possesses few surprises, the usual compliment of spiders and\nwolves. Huge silver bears have taken residence in a small outcrop of limestone\ncaves close to the road and can be considered the top predators in this area.</p>\n<p>Aeglos, Sage and Scribe of Loth Lanath.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"The Old Forest Road Through Eastern Mirkwood"}}},pathContext:{path:"/books/oldforestroadthrougheasternmirkwood"}}}});
