The lookout\nkept his lonely watch upon the old path, knowing it was all in\nvain. No-one traveled these areas any longer, save for the\noccasional woodsman with nothing worth stealing. And yet there it\nwas, a faint clatter of hooves growing clearer by the second,\nheading his way. He let out a long, low whistle, and within\nseconds, his mates were at his side, peering out over the rocks.\n\"Well I'll be! Looks like we just might get our payday here after\nall, my lads!\", the leader whispered excitedly to his men. Quickly,\nthe band of ruffians took their places, lying in wait in the long\ngrass alongside the road. The sound of footfalls was getting louder\nnow, as every man gripped his weapon and held his breath until the\nsignal was given. Around the bend they rode, a small caravan,\nperhaps equal in number to the outlaws that lay in wait, but not\nmore. For a second, the leader questioned the wisdom of an attack,\nbut quickly brushed it off. After all, how many chances at this\ncould they expect out here? And they did still have surprise on\ntheir side. They would frighten these travelers enough with their\nmere appearance, the rest would be simple.</p>\n<p>   Springing from behind the rocks, he held his dented blade high\nand yelled 'Thats far enough, my friends! Lets keep all this civil\nand we won't have no problems...Isn't that right boys?!?! Sure\nenough, the riders checked their horses as the band of two dozen\nleapt from their cover, shouting at the top of their lungs. 'Now\nthen, kind people! If you will all be so good as to hand over your\nvaluables to my little crew here, we can keep the bloodshed to a\nminimum!', he crooned with a devilish grin. Silence. Not a soul in\nthe train of riders so much as flinched at the vagabonds that\nsurrounded them. 'Perhaps you dont speak the Common Tongue very\nwell?', cried the leader as he approached the head rider. Looking\nup in the twilight at the massive man atop the lead horse, the\nthreat died on his lips as he met the piercing gaze of his eyes.\nA single command suddenly rolled off the tongue of the great rider,\nand twenty swords were drawn in unison. Before the suddenly\nspeechless ruffian could so much as blink, a great stone hammer\ncame from seemingly nowhere, crushing his skull with one great\nstroke, as twelve of his men were cut down at that same instant.\nTurning to face the now silent band of outlaws that stood horrified\nalong the road, the mighty rider spoke in a loud, yet strangely\naccented voice: 'Listen well, little men. I give you but two\nchoices. Join my company, and learn what it is like to live as a</p>\n<p>true bandit - or die here and now.' None were so foolish as to\ndefy him, and soon the caravan was on its way once more, its\nnumbers swollen with the fresh recruits, heading south. Along the\nmoonlit horizon there could be espied a broken stone wall, and the\nMaster of the bandits, weary of life in tents, had found a new\nhome for his men. For this was a land of many opportunities, for\nthose willing and able to take them without remorse.</p>\n<p>OOC: A new area is now open, with several things to\ndo/see/kill/be killed by. :)</p>\n<p>Credits: Original design/descriptions - Valesse\nDesign/descriptions/mobs/scripts - Ulwe</p>\n<p>Enjoy.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1458: The Bandits of Anduin's Vale",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1458"}}}});
