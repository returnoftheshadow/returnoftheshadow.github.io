Becoming an elf friend is something I'll leave\nto the rest of you to figure out, however, I must first explain this.</p>\n<p>Elf friendship is represent by an object. if this object is dropped,\nit cannot be picked up. It cannot be looted, so if you die you lose\nelf friend status.</p>\n<p>To use your elf friend status, give the object to the person you\nwant to let know you are an elf friend. If he cares, he'll react\nand give it back to you. If he doesn't he'll just keep it because\nhe thinks you gave him a present. Understanding that since you\ncan't loot it and give it back, for the time being I will answer\nthe question 'Should I give this to this mob' or 'I gave my elf\nfriendship away, can you help me?'</p>\n<p>Right now, aside from dying or dropping your status inducing\nitem there is no way to lose elf friendship status. However,\nin the future this will definately change.</p>\n<p>Good luck and enjoy.\nZ</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1086: Elf Friends",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1086"}}}});
