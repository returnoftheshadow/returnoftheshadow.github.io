This has changed, as follows:</p>\n<p>Magic flags on weapons are largely unchanged, as this reflects, or\ndetermines, whether a weapon is enchanted, is not enchanted, or can be\nenchanted.</p>\n<p>Most magic flags on non-weapon items have been removed. Only items that\ngive a magical affection of some type to the wearer have retained (or\ngained) a magic flag. This, for the most part, means: affects the wearer\nwith some type of spell.</p>\n<p>I might have missed some newer items in this change; if you see anything\nyou don't like, feel doesn't fit with the above outlined rules, etc.,\nsend me a game mail.</p>\n<p>Blent</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1613: Small visual change",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1613"}}}});
