It was never clear exactly what\nthese wraiths and spirits were, as Morgoth later refined thier might into\nfell and foul shapes, creating beasts from tortured spirits to further\ntorment Arda.</p>\n<p>From a later analysis of the histories, I believe these "wraiths" to be\nthe dreams of his evil will, an early manifestation of his desire to do\nevil and control Arda. The dreams of one awakening from slumber, before the\ntrue power is reached.</p>\n<h3>On the Dormancy of Wraiths in the Third Age</h3>\n<p>Wraiths are percieved to be a "new" threat, one recently emerged, as if our\ntime is different to other ages. While I agree that fewer wraiths roamed the\nworld in the third age, I believe that they were always there. The free\npeoples had not the will to look for them.</p>\n<p>I lack the talent myself to commonly see into the spirit world. I have, in\nmy travels, caught glimpses of spirits and wraiths, yet my travelling\ncompanions often reared back in horror as they struggled against an unseen\nfoe, while I stood, impotent and helpless, just watching them.</p>\n<p>On the basis of this, and numerous other sets of anecdotal evidence, I\nbelieve it is not the spirit world that is returning, but instead the talent\nto perceive spirits, long lost to the free peoples, is returning on a broader\nscale. I take this as a gift from the Valar, preparing us for a time of need.\nPerhaps it is their last gift. I know of no Istari wandering amongst the free\npeoples in this age.</p>\n<p>As further evidence to this, I have consulted the famous Red Book of\nWestmarch. This recounts the histories of the Shire, and most notably, those\nof the journeys of that great hero of the Shire, Frodo Baggins (praise him\nwith great praise!). In this book, it is suggested that when Frodo wore the\nOne Ring on Weathertop in the presence of those Wraiths most foul in the\nThird Age, the Ringwraiths, Frodo "entered" the wraith plane, and was able to\n"physically" attack the Ringwriaths, which were, at the time, non-corporeal\nin form.</p>\n<p>This is one of the first recorded accounts of the perception and "mental"\nattack of the wraith form. The One Ring, truly a mighty device, allowed the\nwearer to have a far greater perception of the spirit world wearing the item\nthan if he were not. While perceiving the wraiths in their "true" form, Frodo\ncould then attack them. Had he more willpower, he may have been able to\nwithstand their assaults and defeat them.</p>\n<p>In our age, their are also examples of such items, though, of course, on a\nFAR lesser scale than the One Ring. I myself have worn a magnificent silver\nnecklace which allowed me to see into the spirit world. How these devices\nwork is the subject of further research.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, spirits are manifestations of evil will loosed upon our world.\nThough they have always existed, the combination of a greater perception of\nthe spirit world and the swelling of spirits numbers have made it seem like\na plague has been loosed upon us. Arates has argued against the overall\ndecimation of the spirits, citing, as an example, a player of "beautiful\nmusic". Though I have not experienced this myself, I believe all spirits\nto be evil. This particular spirit IS serving the powers of the shadow,\nalthough we may not divine its purpose.</p>\n<p>We may not divine the Shadow either, until it is too late.<br />\nWestroth, Scholar of Vinyanost.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"On Wraiths and the Spirit World"}}},pathContext:{path:"/books/wraithsandspiritworld"}}}});
