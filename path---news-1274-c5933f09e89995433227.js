There are many dark and evil creatures with\nfew dietary preferences. As a rule if your little stick to the paths.</li>\n<li>The further south you go the more mixed, with respect to strength\nand power the inhabitants are. Orcs and Uruks also become more common.</li>\n<li>Uruk and Orc bandits exist that are not friendly to other uruk\nand orcs that venture from Dol-Guldur.</li>\n<li>South Mirkwood is divided into three 'strips' each is dominated\nby a central path.\n(1) The western most strip consists of light forest and plains and\ncontains the woodsman settlement of Tawarost. The East Anduin Road\nruns from north to south through the plains with a small chalken path\nlinking Tawarost to Osterin.\n(2) The eastern portion contains the straightest and easiest to\ntravel pathway (Mor Erlond). This path connects with the SE portions\nof Mirkwood and eventually arrives at the crossroads for the Dale,\nSouthern and Old Forest Roads. This portion of the path contains the\nmajority of the experience opportunities. However forces of good\nshould be vigilant as there are several encampments and structures\ninhabited by orcs and the more powerful uruk-hai warriors.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(3) The central portion contains the most dense and difficult to\nnavigate terrain. Many areas cannot be ridden through. The Shaded\nWarpath takes a very tortuous route through the area. In the centre\nof the path dominating the area is the small fort of Osterin. Osterin\ncan be a painful barrier as it is sometimes difficult to pass through\nor around, especially if inhabited by a hostile force. Nevertheless\nit is possible to wade the river in order to get around the fortress.\nIt is best approached from the west or from the south.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1274",date:"October 09, 2017",author:"Orendil",desc:"Dol-Guldur FAQ."}}},pathContext:{path:"/news/1274"}}}});
