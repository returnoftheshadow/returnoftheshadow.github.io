While using the defending spec you can reduce all incoming physical damage up to 80% but getting hit reduces the counters and the duration of the skill. Natural attacks has been aligned with the light fighting specialization and to some degree the wild fighting spec. Bite and rend has been aligned with heavy fighting specialization and to some degree the wild fighting spec.</p>\n<p>So to summarize we are trying to make four different play styles for Beornings. If you want the majority of your damage to come from natural attacks pick the light fighting spec. If you want the majority of your damage to come from manual abilities, bite and rend, pick the heavy fighting spec. If you want to be a generalist pick wild fighting and if you want to be a tank go with defending spec.</p>\n<p>With all these changes to the Beorning race we are going to keep the testing port open for another week. As always we are looking for feedback, good or bad, let us know.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1667",date:"March 28, 2018",author:"Maga",desc:"More on Beornings"}}},pathContext:{path:"/news/1667"}}}});
