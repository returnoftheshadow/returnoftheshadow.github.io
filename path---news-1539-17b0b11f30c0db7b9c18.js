The early reports have been scattered, and relatively\nvague; they tell of the ground moving, shaking, even opening in places to\nreveal great chasms and caves. As the reports continue to come in, they\nbecome much more grim; they tell of aftershocks, small tremors, of friend\nand foe alike buried in collapses while exploring what appears to be an\nenormous underground cave system.</p>\n<p>(OOC: A large underground cave system is now accessible beneath southern\nMirkwood. It has numerous connection points to the zones above. This area\nis dangerous, both the environment and the mobiles, so those exploring it\nshould be cautious. There are a number of new quests connected with this\nzone, for all sides of the war, and one is very long and has multiple possible\nendings. There are things to interest every race. And one final comment: even\nif you explore the entire area your first visit, it is very unlikely that you\nwill have seen or found all that there is to see and find.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1539",date:"October 09, 2017",author:"Blent",desc:"Earthquake in Southern Mirkwood"}}},pathContext:{path:"/news/1539"}}}});
