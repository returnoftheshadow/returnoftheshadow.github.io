Respect those who are trying to have fun\nby role-playing their characters.</li>\n<li>No lying to high immortals (Valar, Arata, or Implementors)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Rules Explained:</h3>\n<p>Everyone has more fun if everyone plays by the rules. Penalties for\nrulebreaking range from loss of levels, to character deletion, to\nbanning you from the game entirely.</p>\n<p>In our game there are three player factions at war with each other.\nThe term "Whities" refers to the Human, Dwarf, Wood Elf, Hobbit and\nHigh Elf races. The term "Darkies" refers to the Uruk-Hai, Orc and\nHaradrim races. "Third side" refers to the Uruk-Lhuth and Easterling\nraces. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Multiplaying. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>No multiplaying will be tolerated. You cannot have more then one MUD\ncharacter on at any time.  Linkless players count for multiplaying\n-- to enter one character you must RENT the other (if needed,\nreconnect and rent).  You may own more than one character on the\nmud, but you must follow the switching character rule to change characters. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>No same-side player-killing on the side of good.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Race-war Pkilling:  This involves killing players on opposite\n"sides" of the game as you.  You will see these players\' races only,\nfor example, \'<em>a Hobbit</em>\' or \'<em>an Uruk</em>\'.  See \'HELP RACE WAR\' for\ndetails.</p>\n<p>Whitie-whitie Pkilling:  Player killing on the same side as you is\nanother matter entirely.  When you attack a player on the same side\nas you, you will get a flag called \'rage\'.  This flag prohibits you\nfrom seeing where players of your side are in your area, for five\n(5) minutes.  If you are below level 10, and you are a Whitie, you\ncannot hit another Whitie, unless that Whitie has the rage flag.\nAttacking another character on the whitie side on purpose is disallowed.</p>\n<p>Same side pkill for evil races: Pkilling of other characters on the\nsame side is allowed for evil races.  However, the killer is considered\navenged after one kill, so repetative killing of the same character will\nnot be tolerated, and the offender will be punished.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No communication across sides.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See \'HELP RACE WAR\'.</p>\n<p>Anyone caught giving information to other sides of the race war, be\nit useful or not, will be dealt with in the strictest manner\npossible.  This includes giving it over ICQ, AOL Instant Messenger,\nE-mail, phones, or paper airplanes if you feel so inclined.\nThis includes intentionally behaving in such a way that characters\nof people you know OOC will not be harmed.\nTaunting and antagonizing the enemy is not only quite acceptable, it\nis the only allowable communication between sides.</p>\n<p>Obviously, we cannot monitor your activities.  We ask that you act\nin the best interests of the MUD and keep your information to your\nside.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Observe the "Twenty Minute Rule"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You must wait 20 minutes before switching characters across sides.\nYou must wait five minutes before switching characters on the same\nside. Keep in mind that this amount of time is time spent rented\n-out of the game-, NOT time spent at the rent room, NOT time\nspend in the starting room, and NOT linkless.</p>\n<p>These rules also apply to characters of different people playing\nfrom the same computer.  For example, if you are playing a\ncharacter, and you rent so that your brother can play, he and you\nMUST observe the rules.</p>\n<p>If you do not understand this, ASK AN IMMORTAL.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No abuse of bugs in the game system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you find a bug in the game, post it, or tell an immortal (see\n"wizlist") right away, especially if the bug could be used to a\nplayer\'s advantage. If you are caught abusing a bug for your own\ngood, you\'ll get in trouble, especially if you did not report it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No reimbursement of anything lost due to bugs in the game system.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No reimbursements will be given out. While the game is imperfect,\nand your character may sometimes suffer "unfairly", there will be no\ncompensation of any kind either for the game rough edges or for\nreal-life problems beyond our control.  Exception: when a\nreimbursement is declared on the news board, the post will supercede\nthis rule.</p>\n<p>This is especially true for deaths or losses due to network or\ninternet "lag" or timeouts.  If there is a timeout at the MUD end of\nthings, all players will have no access to the MUD.  In this case,\nan exception (see above) may be made.  In all other cases, we can\'t\nbe held responsible.</p>\n<p>If a reimbursement posting is made and subsequently removed, the\nexcuse "I didn\'t read the news" will not be acceptable.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Equipment Transfer between your own characters.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you own several characters, you may not transfer objects or gold\nfrom one character to another that you own, directly or indirectly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No character trading.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>No character trading is allowed.  This includes selling characters,\nleaving characters with very obvious passwords, trading characters\nfor Magic cards, and the like.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Respect role-playing. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people like to fully act out their characters as they would be\nin a good story, as opposed to playing the mud as if it were a simple\nvideo game. This mud encourages such role-playing as it can be great\nfun. Don\'t wreck the game for role-players.</p>\n<p>The rules are simple. Don\'t try to stretch them or find loopholes.\nThey do not exist not to make life harder for you, but rather to\nkeep it enjoyable for the you and other players of the game. Please\nhelp us make this a nice place to play by following the rules.</p>'}}]}},pathContext:{}}}});
