And disrupting to the fight.</p>\n<p>And you get in return:</p>\n<p>New items! Three, to be exact (the butcher remains unchanged); things\nfor several different classes (and one item exclusively for dark-side\ncharacters).</p>\n<p>Also, I fixed a known bug with the spider: previously, when he retreated\nup into his web, you had to be quick to hit him, or else he would\ndisappear (instead of going back down to wait underneath the web).</p>\n<p>Now, he correctly returns to the area beneath his web if he has not been</p>\n<p>damaged.</p>\n<p>And, some other changes in the underground streambed:</p>\n<p>The load rate for both this spider and the serpent have been increased.\nThe dodge bonus on the black-scaled shield has been increased.</p>\n<p>I think that's about it. Feedback is welcome regarding the new version\nof the enormous, bristly spider, especially concerning difficulty, reward\nrates, and problems/bugs. Send me a game mail.</p>\n<p>Blent</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1616: Mob Revamp: Enormous, Bristly Spider",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1616"}}}});
