Yelps of pain and\nanguish were carried on the air to his tired, but keen, ears.  A feeling of\nhorror swept through him when it smelled it.  The familiar stink danced the\ntango within his nostrils.  It was smoke.  Vincent the ranger leaped from his\ntent and searched the forest floor franticly for something.  For what felt\nlike an eternity to the aging ranger's eyes combed the scene of the burning\nforest until he saw it, a small plant.  The haze of the smoke stung his eyes\nas he ran to the small vegetation, whose fragrance overcame the smells of the\nburning forest.  The one thought that raced through Vincent's mind was to get\nhis plant to safety.  He ran from the flames but as he ran he felt age drip\ndown into his legs, his lungs tightened, his breathing became more rapid and\nhis breaths were short and painful.  The old ranger's body went rigid, and he\ncollapsed onto the ground.  His life, his struggles and survivals, raced\nthrough his mind as he laid shivering in pain.  Was he dying?  Would he be\ndead by the time the trolls and wolves found him and feasted on his flesh and\nbones? As these horrid thoughts went through his body like a poison a\ncomforting image managed to sneak itself into the stream, his plant, his\nprecious plant, was safe.  The ranger gave a sigh and exhaled long and hard\nand with that all went black.  He awoke the next morning or afternoon, he\nwould never know, in the middle of what appeared to be nature's battleground.\nThe ground was littered with corpses of beasts and creatures that had not been\nas lucky as he.  A feeling of heartbreak soon overtook him as his eyes rested</p>\n<p>themselves upon the heap of burnt waste that was his home. Fortunately for\nVincent, the chest that held all of his supplies sat patiently in the midst of\nthe destruction. In a mode of survival Vincent constructed himself a fire\nwhere his tent had once stood.  Fire had taken his home and nearly taken his\nlife now however, fire would be the only thing that kept him alive.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1440: The Flames of Mirkwood",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1440"}}}});
