It was\nnot until the elves forged the Enchanted Path through the northern reaches of\nMirkwood from Forest Gate to the halls of King Thranduil that anyone knew of\nits existance at all. The valley has long been a dark and dreary place. The\nmajority of the fauna sports black coats to blend in with the darkness of the\nplace. However its most prominate feature is its flora, or to be more precise\nthe trees of the valley. The valley is populated by numerous dark hearted\nblack willow trees which do not welcome any human or elven interlopers. This\nwas not a problem for the elves which seldom strayed from the boundaries of\ntheir own path, being content just to pass through the woodlands upon their\njournies. The woodsmen that also used the path were more adventurous and soon\nexploited portions of the valley for its high grade chalk. Denehole digging\nbecame prevalent and the eastern portion of the valley was stripped of its\nwillow trees and quarried for its high grade chalk which was used to make\nmortar for building work. The presence of the denehole diggers with time\nattracted predators in the form of giant spiders and other foul beasts. After\na number of deaths the diggers decided to abandon their quarries and seek\nsafer sources of chalk. The elves dispatched one of their own number to guard\nthe valley. This is how Brethil the Bold came to the Valley of the Willows. It\nis his job to maintain the security along the stretch of the Enchanted Path\nthat passes closeby to the infamous valley.
