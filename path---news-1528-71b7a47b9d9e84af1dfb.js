Teams of Gondorian stonewrights spent nearly a\nyear clearing the rubble and frames of buildings to establish solid\nfoundations for most of the buildings in the city, the most notable\nof which is a great fortress that houses the city government and\nserves as the sole access point to the Northern Road. Help has\ncome from all over the lands to finish the great effort, most notably\nincluding the gift of magical street-lamps all the way from Thranduil\nin his Elvish halls in the East.</p>\n<p>Streams of displaced citizens have returned to the city, crowding\nthe streets and instantly turning Vinyanost once more into a bustling\ncrossroads. New shop-keepers have set up business, and many\nold ones have returned to once more contribute to the city's economy.</p>\n<p>(OOC: Vinyanost has been rebuilt. The city is now geared heavily\ntowards new players, with quests, signs, and information to help them\non their way. More of these will be forthcoming. The lands immediately\naround Vinyanost have also changed slightly; most notably, it is no\nlonger possible to travel north of the city without going through a heavily-fortified area within the city itself. Correspondingly, the Dark Ranger\nthat used to lurk near Maethelburg has crossed the Anduin and remains\naccessible to all.
