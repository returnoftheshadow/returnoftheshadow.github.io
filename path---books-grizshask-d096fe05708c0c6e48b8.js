However\na strong and powerful group of half-orc slaves managed to survive and prosper.\nThere rise to power lead to an increase in raids upon human settlements from\nthe western shores of the Anduin to the Plains of Esgaroth. Eventually the\nraids were curtailed and the tribe sank back into the depths of Mirkwood, ever\npursued by both their orc and human avengers. A few days ago a wild looking\nman was found wandering around the ruins of Vinyanost. He claimed to have been\nabducted from a farmstead close to the town as a child. The now middle-aged\nman said that he had escaped from a tribe of half-orcs a fortnight ago and\noffered to lead a party of rangers into the depths of Mirkwood to free his\nfellow slaves. The rangers were amazed to find that the trees of the forest\nseemed to shift and move and that they could not effectively track in the\nwooded labyrinth that persists in this region.
