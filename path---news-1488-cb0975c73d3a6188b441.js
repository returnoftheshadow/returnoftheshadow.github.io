In\nthis news post I will talk about the zone OOC.  There is a book in the\nVinyanost library that explains the situation more eloquently.  The same\ninformation is also posted on rotsmud.org in the Mythology section.</p>\n<p>I want to emphasize that this is a zone for all creatures of Arda.  If for\nsome reason it is not, send me a mudmail.  This zone is also more than just a\n'nuke-em' zone.  There are riddles involved that need to be solved.</p>\n<p>This is an incrimental zone.  This means that the deeper you go, the harder\nit will become to continue.  Newbies, mid-level characters, and groups of\nlegends should all be able to find something inside.</p>\n<p>But please, and this is your official warning, turn back before it is too\nlate. This is not a zone that is meant to be entirely explored and conquered\non day one.  I will especially warn you that if you should ever find the\nUndead Gatekeeper, he guards a great evil that is not easily overcome.</p>\n<p>As a side note, there are many scripts involed in the zone, over 30 new mobs\nand over 50 new objects were added.  So there should be plenty of fun for all.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1488: Vinyanost Tombs",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1488"}}}});
