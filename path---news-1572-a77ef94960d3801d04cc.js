The main problem is that our phpBB format\nattracts a massive number of spammers (around 50 per day), and the\nvery bad phpBB deletion system requires alot of work to delete each\nof these users.</p>\n<p>The overall effect is that the few players who wanted to get approved\ngot absolutely drowned in the sea of spammers, and we never got\naround to approving your account (because we couldn't find it).\nHowever, we've now figured out how to delete spammers en-masse, so we\ncan keep the database clean enough to service our real players.</p>\n<p>All players who already had accounts will still have them, but if you\nwere waiting on an account, it has been deleted.  Please submit\nanother request for an account in the usual way, at</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rots.us/forums/\">http://www.rots.us/forums/</a></p>\n<p>and mudmail me (Vakaur) in-game with your account name.
