This\nare the first step in a series of changes i plan on making to our mobiles\nhere, in an effort to heighten the challenge and fun in killing them.\nFirst off, Warrior Mobs</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Will now kick and swing along with bash.\nMystic Mobs</li>\n<li>Will as before cast from a range of mystic spells, the frequency of their\ncast rate will have increased. Don't be suprised that when hurt, a mystic\nmobile casts remove poison or regeneration when wounded.\nMage Mobs</li>\n<li>Will as before cast spells. However the type of spell cast is based now\non the mobiles race. I.e an Uruk-Lhuth mobile shall cast from the Uruk-Lhuth\nspell base, etc. Mages will no longer stand idly by at bloodied waiting to die.\nThey have a nice cure self spell that they can use. Also the frequencey of most\nmage mobiles spell casting will have increased.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The changes to Mage and Mystic mobiles are just the start of a piece of work\ni have undertaken. The final goal is to give all mobs who cast a list of spells\nthat it alone can cast from, giving us all around more versatility when building\ncasting mobs.</p>\n<p>You can expect more changes and new features in the near future.</p>\n<p>Khronos</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1460",date:"October 09, 2017",author:"Khronos",desc:"Mobiles"}}},pathContext:{path:"/news/1460"}}}});
