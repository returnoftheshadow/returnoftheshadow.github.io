Once\nupon a time.....during the closing hours of the Third Age there were many\nfierce battles and small skirmishes throughout Mirkwood. In one of these\nskirmishes the great, evil Numenorian warlord Angmacar lead a mixed party of\nuruk-hai, trolls and stone giants up into the mountains to clear out the last\nfew strongholds that the dwarves, elves and mountain men still held. Their\nfirst targets lie in the valley that divided the main body of the mountains\nand the great western spur that ran for many leagues to the west. Angmacar and\nhis mercenaries found very little opposition and soon swept all before them,\nraiding and pillaging as they went along. It was after a particularly bloody\nencounter that a great haul of treasure was discovered. A large caravan\nheading out of Laketown had taken refuge within a fortified castle, when this\ncastle was stormed it was found in addition to the caravan supplies to possess\na great library and hoarde of enchanted treasures. The stone giants after a\nwild drunken feast rebelled against Angmacar and claimed the treasure,\nfortress and surrounding land as their own. Angmacar seeing that his task of\nclearing the forces of good from the area was complete retreated back into\nsouth-east mirkwood with his cultists and uruk-hai warband. The stone giants\nsoon found that the living conditions in the valley could not support them,\nand so they begain to delve into the caverns, caves and dwarven mines of the\nvalley walls. Nothing more was heard about the giants after this.</p>\n<p>Aeglos, Sage and Scribe of Loth Lanath.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"Valley of the Stone Giants"}}},pathContext:{path:"/books/valleyofthestonegiants"}}}});
