The Shadow does not wish to be revealed, its time is not ripe. It strongly resists any attempt to expose it.</p>\n<p>My account begins back in the Third Age, at the time of the War of the Ring. The great, and most renowned battles were fought by the valiant men of Gondor and Rohan, on the fields of Pellenor and before the great gates of Mordor itself. But that was not the extent of the war! For Sauron\'s arm was long, and his power mighty! Indeed, his foul minions swarmed out of Dol Guldur in southern Mirkwood, and from the Grey Mountain Narrows and Mount Gundabad to the north, and his hordes of Easterlings, seduced by promises of power, rode at his word out of their homes in Khand, sweeping through the mighty plains of Dorwinion. Even the Harads, from far to the south, were brought here in force, to assail the free peoples. But the might of the combined armies of the men of Laketown and Dale, the dwarves of Erebor and the Iron Hills under Dain, and the woodelves of Mirkwood, under Thranduil their King, fought valiantly, holding the north and crushing the might of Saurons army, holding out until the Ringbearer completed his task. Even the High Elves of Lorien were forced to defend the passes to their land, against a mighty assault from Dol Guldur. Thus enraged, and stirred into action, the high elves displayed their true might after the ring was destroyed, a force under Celeborn sweeping through Southern Mirkwood, and bringing down the walls of Dol Guldur itself. Under the influence of Thranduil in the north and Celeborn in the south, Mirkwood became again, for a time, Greenwood the Great, the fairest and greatest forest in all of Northern Arda.</p>\n<p>Greenwood was divided, the southern half, up to the Mountains of Mirkwood, under the control of Celeborn and the high elves, and north of the mountains and the Old Forest Road to Thranduil and his wood-elves. Greenwood prospered, the Old Forest Road was restored, and trade flourished between the now mighty cities of men, Dale and Laketown, and the dwarven homes in the east and Imladris, and the newly developing regions in the old Dunedain kingdom in the Northwest, passing along the Old Forest Road and through the passes of the Misty Mountains.</p>\n<p>Vinyanost was established in this time, an important link in the chain of trade, first as a camp spot after the Old Ford at the Anduin, and later developing into a thriving trade centre itself. Maethelburg spurung up also in this time, near the other great crossing of the Anduin.</p>\n<p>But what of Saurons armies? They were not, of course, utterly destroyed in the War of the Ring, nor in the brutal aftermath, when the elves diplayed the power that remained to them in Middle Earth. The Easterlings, mostly, returned to their homelands in Khand, crushed and broken. A large number, however, sought refuge in Rhovanion, finding the broad and open plains to their liking, living on raids and what plunder they could find. The Harads also, far from their homeland, and blocked from returning easily by the new might of King Elessar\'s armies returning to settle Ithilien, sought refuge in Rhovanion, Khand, and wherever they could find land to live in.</p>\n<p>Of Saurons mighty forces of Uruks, orcs, fearsome olog-hai, and trolls, it is hard to characterise the movements. The Olog-hai, mighty trolls that could withstand sunlight, quickly died out. They required the evil breeding methods Sauron had developed to procreate. The curse on Arda is best lost, and forgotten. The uruks and orcs fled, and dispersed, losing what was holding them together, fell to in-fighting. The sought refuge with the wild orcs of the Grey Mountains, and in Mount Gundabad and the other orcish strongholds in the Witch Kings former realm. They also fled to Moria and the Misties. The orcs and goblins plaguing the High Pass were destroyed, their numbers decimated as they were hunted down by the men settling in the North West, as they straddled the trade route between Erebor and Rivendell. The Grey Mountain Orcs ha ve withstood innumerable assaults from the dwarves, who seek the rich minerals of those mountains. Their numbers are few.</p>\n<p>The uruks of Angband formed a loose coalition, and sought to express their power on the "maggots" who took "their world" from them. Raids were conducted on the trade routes. In this time, the cities of Maethelburg and Vinyanost became more fortified, to withstand these assaults.</p>\n<p>In this time also, the powers of the high elves were waining in Arda. Many felt again, the call of the sea, and could not resist, setting out on their last journey, sailing the straight path. The powers of the high elves on Southern Mirkwood were weakening also with this departure. Bands of uruks, cut off from Angbar after raids, settled in the dark forest, finding areas much to their liking and caves in which to make their homes. The Old Forest Road, though for a long time safe, began to be perilous again.</p>\n<p>At last, the hand of the Dunedain of the North and its young kingdom was forced. Angbar was assaulted by an army of men, and the elves remaining in Rivendell. Again, the uruks, crushed by this unexpected and mighty show of force, dispersed through the mountains. Many fled into Southern Mirkwood, swelling the numbers there.</p>\n<p>In this time the Shadow began to rise. The orcs, leaderless and lost, grouped up and found direction. They became a force to be reckoned with in Southern Mirkwood, always on the move so no army could crush them, always striking in numbers at the merchant caravans on the Old Forest Road so no force could resist them. Greenwood again became Mirkwood.</p>\n<p>I see the influence of the Shadow in this. The Harads and Easterlings of Rhovanion, long settled and quiet, begin to stir again at the call of some long forgotten master. The powers of the uruks, long thought to be dwindling appear renewed.</p>\n<p>Now is the time to band together. We must find the shadow now, and crush it before it is too late. If the White Council had crushed Dol Guldur when the Necromancer first emerged, would so much heartache in the War of the Ring been averted?</p>\n<p>We must find the Shadow. Doom awaits us if we fail.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"The History of Vinyanost"}}},pathContext:{path:"/books/historyofvinyanost"}}}});
