It's position is directly on the Anduin, which would open up some trading with the Southern regions while be very close to the woods in which these clans lived. It also helped protect from any forces of aggressive nature attacking the woodmen villages on the western border of Mirkwood such as orcs from the misties, wargs, wolves, and other groups of humans (it was not needed in the woods, for the woodmen could hold their own in nearly any woodland battle). It was quite small, but effective. </p>\n<p>After the war, Mirkwood was nearly as devoid of evil as it was in the past. But with the whole forest for the taking, both the woodmen and the sylvan elves wanted to broaden their land. Conflicts arose with between the same woodmen clans that built Maethelburg and the wood elves (for the clans lived around the forest gate and elf-path). This not only brought upon things such as small skirmishes and deadly battles, but also a general distrust and anger towards the other race by both parties. The disputes, however, grudgingly ended as time went on, when evil came once again. </p>\n<p>When evil started hiding yet again in mirkwood, it was no surprise to the woodmen. They could defend themselves from this evil as they had for years. But spiders and trolls came in greater numbers this time, and dreadfully close to the borders of the forest;; the lands these humans called home. Seeing as if they didn't retreat to somewhere, they would die, the woodmen decided to leave their beloved forest. The only suitable place for living would be a spot on the great nearby river with protection. This place, therefore, would be chosen to be the already built fort of Maethelburg. But since the size of Maethelburg wasn't near large enough to house all of these woodmen, who had since united their diminishing numbers (trolls and spiders are very hungry creatures), an outer city was added on. Farming was started to the west near a smaller river branching off of the Anduin, and the woodmen could still feel almost at home with a small forest to the north of the fort. </p>",frontmatter:{title:"The History of Maethelburg"}}},pathContext:{path:"/books/historyofmaethelburg"}}}});
