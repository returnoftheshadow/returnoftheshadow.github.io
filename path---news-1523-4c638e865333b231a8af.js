Stealing equipment is illegal and will be punished.\nEquipment stealing from a mob is when player A kills a mob with some equipment\nand player B takes it without player A's permission. Equipment stealing from a\nplayer is more complex.  When a whitey dies to a darkie (or mob in PK), the\ndarkie has the option of taking all or none of the equipment. If the darkie\nleaves a corpse full of equipment, whiteys are not welcome to take it without\nthe dead whitey's consent.   On the dark side it works the same way.  If a\ndarkie dies to a whitey, the whitey can leave the equipment or not.  Other\ndarkies may not take the equipment without the dead darkie's permission.</p>\n<p>Convoluted, I know.  Questions, mudmail me.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1523: Equipment stealing",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1523"}}}});
