Baranor was a great friend, but he lacked\nthe resources to help John as he wanted.  He sent two of his young soldiers to\nhelp the small town of Tawarost survive, wishing he could send more.

He did send a scouting party to southern mirkwood, to find out the truth\nabout the growing orcish activity.
