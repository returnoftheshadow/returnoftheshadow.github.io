This is a guide that intends to give a basic knowledge of the game and its workings. It is meant to show you how things work and point you towards areas where you may learn more. The following is a list of questions we commonly hear from new players--so much so that they deserve the status as a frequently asked question. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>What is a MUD?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    A MUD is a game, and like all other games, the main object is to have fun. MUD is short for Multi-User Dimension (or Multi-User Dungeon); an online world, where almost anything is possible. A MUD contains players (other people online playing the game) and mobs (computer controlled creatures in the game that the players interact with). The game is a text-based adventure, where the player roams the world by reading text that describes each room, the mobs and objects in the room and the exits to and from the room. In this way, no graphics are seen, and how the world appears is all up to the imagination and interpretation of the player.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    In most MUDs, players can interact with each other by a system of commands. These commands are all basic, usually consisting of every-day things. Players can chat, (send a message to all of the players in the game with the chat channel on) narrate, (same as chat, but usually in-character information), sing (sing a song), tell (send a private message to a player) or say (send a message to everyone in the character's room). Other commands, including directional commands, are essential. These directional commands are n (north), e (east), s (south) and w (west). All of the commands in RotS can be listed with the command commands.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    You can log in to RotS using telnet or your favorite MUD client (see our links page for our favorites). When you first log in, you will be prompted to into your character's name. If you don't have a character already, you'll have to choose an unused name appropriate for a Tolkien setting and a secure password. You will then be led through the creation process for your new character. Once you've created your character, you'll be able to log in and play it whenever you please.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    The purpose of RotS is to enjoy exploring our Tolkien-inspired world while leveling up and fighting monsters in the classic DikuMUD style. Once you've attained a decent level, you can even begin to participate in the race war between the Free Peoples of Arda and the forces of the Shadow. This is known as PK or player-killing and is an fast-paced, intense fight between two real players.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    While leveling up in RotS, you will also be gathering new equipment to help you in your goals.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Armor will help you survive a beating from both enemy mobiles (computer controlled opponents) and enemy players.</li>\r\n                        <li>For the melee-fighting oriented classes, weapons will be the bread and butter to your damage dealing capacity.</li>\r\n                        <li>Food and water will allow you to continue regenerationg hit points, stamina and movement points.</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                    <h2>What is Return of the Shadow MUD?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Return of the Shadow is a game based on the Fourth Age of Arda, J.R.R. Tolkien's wonderful world of fantasy. Game play takes place after the destruction of the One Ring. After Sauron's fall, a period of peace was laid about the land, and the Elves, Humans, Dwarves, and Hobbits prospered. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    However, these times of peace were forever threatened by a growing danger in Greenwood the Great. Once again, Orcs and other hideous things squirmed in dark places and began to multiply; the mighty forest became Mirkwood again. In response to these troubling events, the Free Peoples of Arda took alliance once again to combat the still unknown force behind the ever-rising threat from the forest--a threat which became known as the Shadow. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    As a player of RotS, you get to decide whether you will aid the Free Peoples in their fight against the Shadow or fester in the depths on Mirkwood as a minion of its power. Since the Shadow is fledgling and has not come to its true power, players who choose to side with it will play races which have been intentionally weakened. The dark races of Arda face unusual quirks and disadvantages that the Free Peoples needn't worry about; and for this reason, we recommend evil characters only to experienced MUDders.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h1>Gameplay</h1>\r\n                    <h2>Where do I find newbie equipment?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    When you log in for the first time, you will be at the <em>Great Crossroads</em> where you will be presented with instructions on obtaining a basic kit of gear. Any time you die, you will return to the crossroads where you can request another kit. However, keep in mind that newbie kits are meant for new players and, as such, the higher you level the less you will be given when you request a kit.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>Where do I get money and buy things?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    As a starting player, money may seem fairly difficult to come by. However, as you explore Arda and learn where good, easy-to-get loot can be found, you will quickly forget that you ever had problems finding money. If you want to find those good loot spots quickly, keep an eye out for thieves and bandits--these mobiles are almost always aggressive and will attack unwary travelers. Due to this, they commonly congregate around stashes of gear and other stolen goods. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>Where do I practice my skills and spells?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    There are teachers spread across Arda, hidden in towns, forests and other areas. If you're in the same room as a guildmaster, typing practice will present you with a list of skills or spells available for you to learn. Once you have found a guildmaster, simply type practice skill name to spend one of your practice points on a skill. Don't worry about mis-using practice sessions--you can always reset your practices later if you find out that you made some bad decisions. Knowing this, it is fairly easy to wander around your first town and find a teacher willing to improve your skills. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    It is also important to note that RotS' class system is completely dynamic; and as a consequence, you must visit teachers based on what skills you wish to learn--not what class you may have chosen. You will have to utilize abilities from every class in the game, so you will have to learn the locations of many teachers and guildmasters if you wish to truly become a powerful opponent. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Once you are in-game, you can see the list of all warrior and ranger skills by typing man spell list (where man is short for manual); similarly you can view all mystic powers with man power list and all mage spells with man spell list. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>\r\n                        Where is it safe to kill mobiles for experience?\r\n                    </h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    We have gone through a great deal of trouble to make certain that portions of the world are very safe for new, good-aligned characters. In particular, this includes the tract of land between Vinyanost and Maethelburg (as well as the land north of Maethelburg) as well as the lands between Maethelburg and the Elven Halls (this area is known as the Elven Path). Keep in mind that when we say an area is safe, we mean that you can be fairly sure that you will not be attacked by another player while exploring that area; mobiles in those zones can still be very dangerous. Also keep in mind that we have done no such thing for players of the evil side--and this is very intentional. The evil side is meant for experienced players who do not want help. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    When killing mobiles for experience (also known as xping), remember to use the consider command liberally; this command will tell you how strong a mobile is compared to your character. Keep an eye on your health and use the flee command to leave battle if it drops too low; also remember that it is possible (and very likely!) to fail attempts to flee! \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    While xping, it is important to stay healthy as well as keep a good supply of food and light sources available. Once an animal has been killed, you can usually butcher the corpse for meat depending on how scrawny the specimen may have been; to do this, simply type butcher corpse. You can keep yourself alive for weeks at a time by living on butchered meat and fresh ponds. It is also important to keep a number of torches available for long, winter nights and the dark forests of Mirkwood. Remember to visit the dry goods store in your nearest town on a regular basis to keep your supply up to snuff. \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <h2>How does player killing work here?</h2>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                    Player killing is perhaps the most important part of RotS; you will eventually map our entire world and try every combination of classes that whets your interest; and it will then be time for you to take your knowledge and use it in player versus player combat. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when performing player killing: \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>You cannot see players of the opposing side on the who list; it is always unknown whether an evil player may be lurking near you, and this is a very exciting component of the game.</li>\r\n                        <li>If you are a good-aligned race (a Human, Wood Elf, Hobbit or Dwarf), it is illegal to kill other good-aligned races.
