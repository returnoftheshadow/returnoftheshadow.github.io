At the end of this month (March 31), all\nMaia will be set to retired on the production server. All development is done\non the test machine, so there is no reason to have access to everything on the\nproduction box. In conjunction with this change, players on the test machine\nwill be cleaned up and limited to active personnel. If you are active in the\nbuilding process, please mudmail me (Ingolemo) before the 31st. This message\napplies to levels 92, 93, and 94. Please note that no characters on the\nproduction server will be deleted. Immortal work on the production box\nconsists entirely of administrative duties therefore non-administrative\npersonnel do not need privaledges. If you have any questions, feel free to\nmudmail me or talk with other high level immortals.</p>\n<p>Ingolemo</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1606: Immortal Restructuring",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{path:"/news/1606"}}}});
