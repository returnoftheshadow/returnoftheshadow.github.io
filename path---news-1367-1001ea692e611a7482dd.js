The\nonly races who can legally lead a mount from DG are the ones who can lead the\nmount at the time the quest is done.  It has come to our attention that\nplayers have been \"stealing other player's mounts as a reward during PK. This\nis not legal, and is a direct exploitation of a bug that occurs once a player\nrents with the mount.   Black steeds may only be led by Uruk-Hai, boars may\nonly be led by Orcs, and Wyvern may only be led by Hobbits.  Anyone caught\nleading a mount illegally will be punished to the fullest extent.  Consider\nthis your warning.  On a side note, we would like to apologize for any trouble\nthis may cause and ask for your patience with this matter.  Thank you in\nadvance.</p>\n<p>Signed,</p>\n<p>Elagor</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1367",date:"October 09, 2017",author:"Elagor",desc:"Mount Confusion"}}},pathContext:{path:"/news/1367"}}}});
