Thanks to the extensive work of Azriya, balance and order have now\nbeen restored. Many weapons of exceptional and especially legendary quality\nhave seen changes, and I am pleased to say much of these were improvements.\nAdditionally, some non-weapon legendary items have been made to correspond in\npower more with their difficulty to obtain. A brief, intentionally vague\nsummary of only some of the changes is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some of Kabaal's weapons may have new appearances</li>\n<li>Many of the more damaging weapons should see improvement</li>\n<li>The staves used by the magical creatures of Arda have undergone some\nchanges</li>\n<li>Many hard-to-obtain items have received improvements in their quality,\nspecifically those of Goblin Gate, but others as well</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, many thanks go to Azriya for his dedication and effort, as well\nas Vakaur for facilitating the implementation. Any items which do not\nautomatically update can be traded in for new versions (please mudmail\nor ask myself or Azriya to inquire as to which items these may be).\nSince weapons have been severely unbalanced for the past few weeks,\nI hope everyone enjoys.\n-Felagund Finrod</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1413: Balance Restored",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1413"}}}});
