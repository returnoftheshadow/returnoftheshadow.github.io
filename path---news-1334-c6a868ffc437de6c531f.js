Let me clarify on what\nis and is not appropriate behaviour between lhuths and darkies. Acceptable\nBehaviour: When a member or members of the Free Peoples enters the PK Area, it\nis acceptable for Lhuth and Hai/Orc to temporarily stop fighting to fight the\ncommon and more hated enemy: the Whities. After the whitie is killed and/or\nleaves, cooperation is no longer legal. Let me also clarify what cooperation\nmeans: Cooperating simply means you have the -choice- not to attack and kill\neachother, but instead to focus on a common target. This does -not- include\ngrouping of any kind, any form of following, any equipment trading/exchange,\nor the casting of favorable spells. Cooperation does include communication,\nthough not sitting in the same room and 'chatting it up'. Yells are\nacceptable, since you do not know if the enemy is attempting to lie to you or\nnot. The following is entirely inappropriate behaviour: Grouping of any kind,\ncooperation when no whities are present, conversation in the same room without\nfighting, casting of helpful spells, dropping/giving/exchanging equipment of\nany kind, assisting in the killing of a mob or completion of a quest. I hope\nthis clarifies the issue, and those found guilty of ignoring these rules will\nbe punished.\nI will close with a line from HELP RACEWAR:\nIf you are to come accross a member of the opposite\nrace you have two choices: Kill or be Killed. There is no mercy.</p>\n<p>-Felagund Finrod</p>",frontmatter:{title:"News 1334: Lhuth/Uruk-hai/Orc Interaction",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1334"}}}});
