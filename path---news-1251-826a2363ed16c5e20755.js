This will no longer be tolerated. From this point\non it will be considered a general abuse of a bug in the game. The mounts\nshould be ridable only by their tamers and no-one else. Furthermore, taming\nand "giving" away a lizard mount to someone is no longer acceptable either, as\nthis would also be considered an abuse of a general bug in the mount system.\nTo sum up this post, stealing or giving away of someones lizard mounts is no\nlonger acceptable. At some point in ths future this code will be altered to\nmake this a non-issue, but for now the punishments will be the following.\nFirst offence - loss of 3 levels\nSecond offence - loss of 5 levels\nThird offence - deletion of character</p>\n<p>PS - if your character already has a lizard mount and should not,\nplease notify an imp ASAP and it will be exchanged for a proper mount\nfor the race of your character. This means that this rule is not\nretro-active, so please be forthcoming and everything will go smoothly.\nThanks for your co-operation.\nVaitya</p>',frontmatter:{title:"News 1251: Mounts",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1251"}}}});
