I will first tell you my story, but this is not just an\\nautobiography. It is a cry for reason, but I'll allow you to come to\\nthat conclusion yourself.</p>\\n<p>I was born in a stonewalled town of Maethelburg, about a score years ago\\nas the first and only son of Geven Tolbar. My sister, Sada, was to come two\\nyears later. She was the last of my father's offspring, as our mother died\\nduring her birth. I don't remember her well at all, save a fading memory\\nof a beautiful woman reading to me, as I laid curled next to her, my head in\\nher lap.</p>\\n<p>Now, for those who are not from Maethelburg, if you should find this\\ntext, let me give you some history, and insight into the town. During the\\nThird Age many men lived in western Mirkwood, and they formed their own\\nclans and the like, and controlled a small area. These woodmen were very\\nproficient in living off the forest, and did so for many, many years. At\\nan unknown point in time, these clans joined together, and built a small\\nwooden fort, on the Anduin, partially for trade, and partially for other\\nreasons. This fort was built by my ancestor, Galleth Tolbar, and named\\nMaethelburg.</p>\\n<p>Soon after, a renowned halfling, by the name of Frodo Baggins, succeeded\\nin his quest, and destroyed the One Ring. Immediately, the dark forest\\nMirkwood began to lighten, and the evil receded. It was at this time, the\\nwoodmen of the forest sought to expand their land, and their hold, on the\\ngreat forest, which was temporarily renamed Greenwood. Unfortunately,\\nthe Elves that occupied the area did as well.</p>\\n<p>And so as it so often happens in our world, greed led to fighting and\\nthen the fighting led to anger and distrust. As a result, the woodmen moved\\nout of the forest that made them prosper and built a great walled city\\naround their fort. Sadly, the inhabitants of Maethelburg still shun the Elven\\npeople.</p>\\n<p>My father is an architect, as was his father, and so on, back until the\\nday's of Galleth Tolbar, who built the wooden fort that is still standing\\ntoday. Some may not think it so, but architecture is an art, and a skill, and\\nmy father is one of best to ever live. When I was a young adolescent, my\\nfather began to teach me the ins and outs of the trade, but I quickly\\nbecame bored with the idea.</p>\\n<p>Now, Maethelburg is a very traditional place. Sons took over their\\nfather's trades, and change was frowned upon by most. However, my\\ngeneration began to look at things differently. As young adolescents we\\nbegan to form secret clubs, in which we snuck in poetry and literature from\\nfar away places, that we managed to obtain. Now, many people may find\\nthis to be odd, but you must remember, such things were taboo in my\\nland. We began to write our own stories and our own poems, and tell them\\nto each other. We learned so much during those years, and we grew wiser\\nthan our parents quickly, as they had no exposure to the cultures of lands\\nfar away, nor even cared for the finest of literature.</p>\\n<p>With education comes realization, and we realized that as we hid in the\\nshadows, a small group, nothing changed on the outside, so we decided\\nthat if Maethelburg was to become a city of enlightenment and freedom of\\nthought, then we would have to make these things public. So we did.\\nOf course this was taken as a sign of rebellion, which in a way it was.\\nFew would listen to us, but some did. Our group grew larger, and our\\ngatherings became more frequent. It was at this time I met the two people\\nwould change my life forever.</p>\\n<p>An Elf came to our town. Now, this wasn't totally unheard of, but it was\\nrare enough that it caused people to whisper about it. This Elf was\\ndifferent though. He walked through the cobblestone streets as if he owned\\nthem, unlike the others who crept through the town trying to remain\\ninconspicuous. He dressed flamboyantly, smiling at all whom he passed.\\nSomehow, he learned of one of our meetings, and there he introduced\\nhimself as Perthos, and he read some of the greatest poetry we had ever\\nheard. We stood and applauded him, and the things he had to say. It was\\na very joyous night indeed.</p>\\n<p>Perthos began to visit Maethelburg more and more often, annoying the\\ngrown men of our city who resented him not only for his heritage, but\\nalso his charisma. Others quickly took to him, myself and my sister\\nincluded. The three of us became very good friends, and upon Perthos's\\narrival into town, Sada and I could be seen running to greet him, and soon\\nthe three of us was to become the four.</p>\\n<p>One day, Perthos brought a companion with him. A man wearing all white,\\nsurrounded by a large white cloak, his face hidden behind a white hood.\\nHe carried with him nothing but a large staff, which he used as he walked.\\nWhen we asked Perthos to introduce himself to his friend, he quickly\\nchanged the subject, and the man remained quiet. Later that evening, we\\nhad a small gathering in the park, which was for original poetry. Many\\nmen stood and spoke powerful words, and finally the stranger asked if he\\ncould speak. We agreed, and he took to the podium and recited perfectly a\\nfamous poem. One young man stood up and denounced the stranger,\\nyelling \\\"Fool, this is for original art only. Do not recant other's\\nwork we all know that poem was written by a man named Arates.\\\" The\\nstranger nodded, and coyly replied, \\\"So I take it you've heard of me?\\\"</p>\\n<p>The crowd gasped in response as Perthos burst into laughter. He later\\ntold us he thought it would be amusing for us to meet the man whom's\\nworks we often discussed. Arates often came to our meetings and joined\\nin our philosophical debates, but rarely did he speak publicly.</p>\\n<p>By this time I had reached 16, and was very nearing 17. That is when my\\nfather, Geven, approached me, and said I should stop wasting my time\\nwith these foolish dreams and worthless philosophy, and come work with\\nhim. I was insulted, as I never had been before, to see my own father\\nrenounce my freewill and call all of my beliefs trash. We got into a\\nheated debate, and many things were said that I will not write of here. I\\nleft my home, infuriated, and decided to spend the evening in the park.\\nI sat there alone, watching the night sky, and contemplated what to do\\nwith my life. There were sounds about the night, none I was paying\\nattention to, until I heard Perthos voice rise high above the rest.\\nWhat he said, I cannot remember, but it caused me great alarm, and I ran\\nin the direction the shout come, and there, at the northern gate in the\\nwall, stood 3 guards, axes and swords drawn, facing Perthos, his rapier\\npoised for attack.</p>\\n<p>I quickly shouted, \\\"What is the meaning of this? What is going on here,\\\"\\nand for once my surname came in useful.</p>\\n<p>Perthos just glanced in my direction, his face trying to remain\\nexpressionless, but giving off obvious signs of remorse. He said nothing.\\nThe head guard spoke up, \\\"Eric! This Elf was caught attempting to\\nleave town, after assaulting your sister!\\\"</p>\\n<p>\\\"What!\\\" I screamed in disbelief, \\\"This man would never do anything to\\nharm Sada,\\\" and although I cannot say for sure, a part of my mind seems\\nto recall the sound of Perthos whispering \\\"So true\\\", accented by a tear\\nstriking the ground.</p>\\n<p>\\\"Sir, I swear it so,\\\" continued the Guardsman \\\"there was a shortened\\nscream coming from Miss Tolbar's room. When I went to investigate, I\\nseen him kneel by her, and she was crying. He looked me in the eye and\\nran, and I gave chase!\\\"</p>\\n<p>\\\"It's true, son,\\\" a dry, cold voice said, from the shadows. Slowly, my\\nfather stepped into the dim light of the lanterns. I was so confused, I\\nlooked up at Perthos and seen the tears in his eyes, and I wasn't sure\\nwhat to think.</p>\\n<p>His face formed a grimace, and, although he said it to all, he spoke to\\nme, when he cried \\\"Damn you all!\\\" and thrust his sword into the ground.\\nBefore anyone could react, Perthos had somehow, probably magically,\\nmanaged to scale the stone wall. He looked down on us, silhouetted in\\nthe dim light of the lanterns, and the glowing stars of the night sky,\\nand spoke,</p>\\n<p>\\\"I must say farewell<br />\\nfor it seems I am to fail.<br />\\nAnd because I am not your brother,<br />\\nI am forced to lose a love like none other.<br /></p>\\n<p>And I hope that you might<br />\\ncry throughout the night<br />\\nfor my heart has been slain,<br />\\nbecause you are so ruthless and vain.\\\"<br /></p>\\n<p>With that, he leapt from the wall, and I have yet to see him again. I\\nquickly ran home, to see my sister, ignoring the calls at my back for me\\nto wait. When I arrived, I see her sitting on the edge of her bed, her\\nnightgown soaked with tears. I approached to comfort her, and she cried\\nbriefly, then wiped the tears away.</p>\\n<p>I must tell you what happened, she sobbed, \\\"before they return.\\\"</p>\\n<p>In a vain attempt to comfort her, I responded, \\\"No, no, no,\\nyou've been through enough.\\\"</p>\\n<p>\\\"You don't understand,\\\" she cried and then she told me the truth, as I\\nhad never expected.</p>\\n<p>Perthos did enter her room that night, and she did scream in a panic.\\nShe was shocked to see an intruder, but quickly Perthos reassured her it\\nwas but him, and it was at that time he confessed his love for her. Not as a\\nfriend, he claimed, but as words could not explain. Sada was shocked,\\nand wasn't sure what to say, and before she could even smile, the head\\nguardsman and our father burst into the room, weapons raised. It was\\nthen Perthos had bolted through the window, to leave our lives forever.</p>\\n<p>I love my sister, and I have never held anything from her, or lied to\\nher in any way, and nor she to me. I knew what she said was true,\\nbecause it all clicked, like a puzzle you can't solve until someone finally\\nhands you the rest of pieces. I left that night, renouncing my heritage, and\\nforsaking the town of Maethelburg. I lived for years along the Anduin Valley,\\nsleeping in caves, and occasionally working for farmers in exchange\\nlodgings. I lived by my wits, and by my sword for years. I've recently\\nsettled in Vinyanost, a place which seems to tolerate those who are\\nsomewhat different. How long I will reside here, I do not know.</p>\\n<p>I haven't seen Perthos since that day, nor Sada, nor Arates. I fear all\\nthree of them hate me now, and I cannot blame them. I have not seen\\nGeven, the man I used to say was my father, but I can honestly say I care\\nnot what he thinks. I miss my friends, and I often wonder what I would say\\nto my sister, or to my mentor, Arates, if I see them again, but not as\\noften as I think about what would happen if I seen Perthos. Would I fall to\\nmy knees and beg him for forgiveness? Or would my inner rage erupt and\\ncause me to run him through for ripping apart my family, and hurting my\\nsister so much? I don't know. I can honestly tell you, I don't care to\\nfind out.</p>\\n<p>I write this for two reasons. The first is the most obvious, closure.</p>\\n<p>I'm not sure how effective this will be, but it may help, but the second is\\nthe most important. It is for you, the reader, to comprehend this text, and\\nto realize the misgivings of prejudice, and to realize that such things are\\nmore evil than the things that dwell in the depths of Mirkwood. I hope\\nsomeday to return to Maethelburg, and see that the city is now free of all\\nforms of hatred.
