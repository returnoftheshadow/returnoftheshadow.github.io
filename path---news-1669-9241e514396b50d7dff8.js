So, it is upon a heap of crushed and broken\nbodies that we found what we were looking for. Your research into the old\ntexts was correct. There was once a tall tower that was built upon a site of\ndark power. The hobbits that lived there were slowly corrupted until they\nbarely remembered their true selves. The dark power ate away at them, little\nby little, such that they didnt even notice the change happening within them.\nOver time, the tower sank deeper and deeper into the ground until it finally\nfell.
