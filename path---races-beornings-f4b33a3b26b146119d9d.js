Unlike other Men, they had the ability to change into bears. They enjoyed being a bear so much they forgot how to turn back into humans. They seem to have the same life-span of mortal men, and could speak in both the tongue of men and of animals. They are not very fond of Dwarves, and were bitter enemies of the Goblins. They hunt neither bird nor beast, their diet consisting mostly of cream and honey.</p>\n<h2>Abilities</h2>\n<p>Beornings receive a bonus to bashing and are harder to detect while hiding. This race is intended for seasoned players because of their item, mount, and spell restrictions. They are incapable of casting any Mage spells.</p>\n<table class="table">\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Strength</th>\n            <th>Intelligence</th>\n            <th>Will</th>\n            <th>Dexterity</th>\n            <th>Constitution</th>\n            <th>Learning Ability</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td>Very High</td>\n            <td>Very Low</td>\n            <td>Low</td>\n            <td>Normal</td>\n            <td>Very High</td>\n            <td>Low</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>',frontmatter:{title:"Beornings",raceid:6}}},pathContext:{path:"/races/beornings"}}}});
