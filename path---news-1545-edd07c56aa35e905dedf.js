The gatekeeper saw a tall grey haired man,\nclothed in green, and recognized him as a ranger from Mirkwood.  When Vincent\nentered the fortress, he asked to be taken directly to Logan.  Upon meeting\nwith the captain, he related a tale of violence and magic.  "The evil races of\nMirkwood are warring again.  I  was out hunting deer near my tent when I heard\na large party approaching on the road.  I hid in the undergrowth and was very\nsurprised to see a war party of dreaded Uruk-Lhuth thunder past me on the Old\nForest Road.  Magus himself was in the lead, followed by no less than 50 of\nthose evil magic orcs. After they passed, I tracked them  a ways, seeing the\ntracks turn north, into the mountains.  Silently I followed  the tracks to\nUngorod!  From a hidden peak I watched a mighty battle ensue,  as the old\nenemies Magus and the Chieftain led their forces against each other.   Many of\nthe Uruk-Hai fled like cowards, running south into the forest while   Magus\nwas busy relishing his victory.  The mountain fortress of Ungorod now  is held\nby the Lhuth."  Logan frowned, and replied "That may well be to our advantage.\nMayhap the road is safer with those foul Lhuth further from it. Only time will\ntell."</p>\n<p>OOC:  Many changes have been made in the east.  There are new quests for\nthe all races.  Please report anything strange to immortals.
