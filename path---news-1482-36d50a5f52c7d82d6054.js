In return for assistance from hobbits in the\narea who helped in the construction, Gondor has provided a great service to\nthem. A great bridge has been built spanning the Anduin River so that the\nhobbits can easily cross the great river to get to the rich fields on the east\nside. They farm those as best they can.  Since the threat from strange\ncreatures has been so high in recent times, the hobbits have also taken to\nguarding the bridge for their own kind.  They also are quite favorable to those\non the trade route, since it gained them their bridge.</p>\n<p>Many thanks are due to the immortals who worked hard on this including Azriya,\nUlwe, Kandi, Adunakhor, Maga, Vaitya, and many others who I have probably\nforgotten.</p>\n<p>Notes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This is effective next reboot (morning of October 18th, 2006).</li>\n<li>The map code for the Anduin will be updated shortly, so even if the map does\nnot show it, there is a crossing.</li>\n<li>This is the first of a series of changes that will be occurring.
