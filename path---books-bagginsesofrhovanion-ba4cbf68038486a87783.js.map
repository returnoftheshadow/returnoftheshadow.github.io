They departed in a ship that bore\\nthe wings and the figurehead of a swan from the harbors of the Grey Havens\\nof Cirdan, the Shipwright.  Their sailing was wonderful, even for the hobbits\\nthat were timorous of sailing and the matters that dealt with boats and riding\\nupon water.</p>\\n<p>   Gandalf sat near the bow with his head in his hands, seemingly deep in thought.  He\\nhad a pipe in his mouth, and he was muttering soft, quiet words to himself.  Upon his\\nface, there was a broad smile and the lines of age that had once bejeweled his\\nforehead and cheeks seemed to disappear.  At first glance, he seemed much younger\\nthan he used to look, no longer weary and bent, but tall, straight, and proud.  A second\\nglance would let one see that he was still the same old Gandalf, hair as white as new-\\nfallen snow, a long shaggy beard, and deep, dark, understanding eyes.  All of the crew\\nof Cirdan's ship was alive and bustling with song and speech.  Frodo and Bilbo\\nmarveled at how joyous these elves appeared, and both wondered why this was so.</p>\\n<p>   Bilbo, then finding his thoughts too much to ponder, spoke aloud and asked why\\nthere was so much celebration, despite the fact that he knew that the Ring had been\\ndestroyed, and Sauron's power had been vanquished at last.  An elf stood tall and\\nspoke with eloquent words, saying, \\\"We are returning to Aman! The Blessed Realm!\\nwhere the rest of our kindred dwells!  Oh how wonderful it will be to see the splendor\\nof Valinor, and the place where the Two Trees once stood!  Oh how I have longed for\\nthis moment!\\\"  The elf then sat down and began to sing a song about the Elder Days,\\nthe days when Middle-earth was free from trouble.</p>\\n<p>   Beside Gandalf sat Elrond Half-Elven, and Galadriel, the Lady of the Golden Wood.\\nThe three keepers of the three elf rings were departing for their home from which they\\nwere spawned.  The three were speaking loudly, and clearly, so that Frodo and Bilbo\\ncould hear their conversation.  While they listened, they were reminded once more\\nthat Gandalf was one of the Maiar, a people of the Valar.  He had not always been\\nknown by as Gandalf.  In his youth, he was Olorin, one of the mightiest, and perhaps\\nthe wisest of the Maiar.  Amongst him was Sauruman, who was known as Curumo,\\nRadagast, who was known as Aiwendil, and Alatar, and Pallando.  These were the\\nfive wizards who were chosen by the Valar to go into Middle-earth.  According to\\nGandalf, he alone was successful in his mission, and the others failed, for they were\\ndrawn to the lands of Middle-earth, and fell in love with its creatures, or had a lust for\\npower.</p>\\n<p>   Galadriel spoke of her people, the Galadrim, whom she loved dearly.  She\\nmentioned that Celeborn had chosen to stay in Lothlorien for a while yet to enjoy his\\nlast days upon those fair Golden Woods.  Elrond spoke of his father, and his mother,\\nand how he wished to see his mother, Elwing once more.  The histories of these\\npeople had been great and extensive, and for that reason, they shall not be told here.</p>\\n<p>   Now Bilbo and Frodo were filled with joy and gladness at hearing the happiness of\\nall of these people.  Before, Galadriel had seemed filled with a lot of grief, and\\nsadness.  But now, she seemed a young elf-maiden, filled with happiness and bereft of\\nher woes.  Both Bilbo and Frodo smiled and joined in a few of the songs that the elves\\nsang, and forgot about their worries for a while.</p>\\n<p>   After many days of sailing upon those tranquil, crystal clear waters, they began to\\nsee a massive pinnacle of stone rise up out of the horizon.  All of the elves stood up\\nand shouted for joy, causing their songs to rise up and laughter to fill the air.  Some of\\nthem proclaimed, \\\"Taniquetil! Home of Manwe Sulimo, King of Arda!  There too\\ndwells Varda Elentari, Queen of the Stars! A Elbereth! Gilthoniel! silivren penna\\nmiriel o menel aglar elenath! Na-chaered palan-diriel o galadhremmin ennorath,\\nFanuilos, le linnathon nef aear, si nef aearon!\\\"  This they sang, and the rest of the\\nverses of the song, in reverence to their Queen that they would soon meet.</p>\\n<p>   The hobbits were filled with a sudden joy, for they had never seen a pinnacle so\\nhigh and mighty before in their lives.  The ship seemed to be gaining speed, and the\\nhorizon began to be filled with glorious, lofty mountains.  Taniquetil stood amidst\\nthose mountains, living up to its name as the highest mountain in all of Arda.  Frodo\\nwas filled with a sudden short fear, for he had never before realized what majesty the\\nrealm of the Valar had actually held.  He then realized that he was only viewing the\\noutermost part of Valinor, the Pelori, those mountains that had been raised by the\\nValar as a defense against Melkor and the evils that he had wrought.</p>\\n<p>   The ship landed upon the shore of Valinor, and many tall elves, with incredibly\\nbright faces greeted the ship.  They were filled with great mirth, for they were finally\\nmeeting the lost ones of their Kindred.  These elves were known as the Sea-elves, a\\nbranch of the Teleri.  These elves dwelt at Alqualonde, the haven of the Teleri.  These\\nelves were called Sea-elves, for their love of the sea, and of sailing.  Of all of the elves\\nin Middle-earth, these were the ones who were the most skilled at shipbuilding and\\nsailing.  There, the company was received with great joy and happiness, and were\\ntaken into the homes of the Teleri for several days and housed, fed, and told of the\\ngoings-on of the time.</p>\\n<p>   A few days passed, and it came time to go before Manwe Sulimo, in order to receive\\ntheir official welcome to Valinor.  Thus the company did, and the whole way there,\\nthe hobbits were filled with a small fear, yet their hearts were filled with joy.  They\\ntraveled up the slopes of Taniquetil, and found at the top a massive mansion, overlaid\\nwith the richest jewels and stones of the entire world.  They entered, and many Maiar\\nand other noble lords of the Valar stood.  Eonwe, the Herald of Manwe was there, and\\nhe greeted them with a deep bow.  He beckoned them to follow him down an\\nincredibly, richly decorated hall.</p>\\n<p>   The hall opened up into a massive chamber, which was adorned with many\\npaintings and jewels, and the airs of the world could be seen as the ceiling.  Thus\\nEonwe proclaimed, \\\"Lord Manwe, King of Arda, here are the members of the alliance\\nof the Ring!\\\"  He announced all of their names, and titles, and then bowed low to the\\nground, and stepped back.  The members of the company bowed low in return, and\\nfell to their knees before Manwe.  Manwe smiled, and bade them to stand.  He then\\nstood long silent, staring and pondering at each individual.  After a long silence, he\\nfinally spoke.  His voice was soft, understanding, stern, compassionate, and powerful.</p>\\n<p> \\\"Your deeds have not gone unheard, friends.  It is a wonderful thing that you now\\nstand before me in my court.  For your deeds and troubles in the lands, it is only\\nappropriate that you dwell in Valinor, and remain here ere the end of the world.\\nOlorin, it greatly saddens me to hear that Alatar and Pallando have not been heard of\\nand supposedly still dwell in the lands of East Middle-earth.  Sorrow filled my heart\\nwhen I heard that Curumo had betrayed us, and had decided to join Sauron and his\\nevil thoughts.  Folly it was when Sauron joined Melkor and his foul plans during the\\nGreat Music.  But alas!  He is now vanquished, and his power is gone!\\\"  Each of the\\ncompany stood silent in awe and amazement of the power of Manwe, and his\\nsplendor.</p>\\n<p>   Manwe then addressed Frodo and Bilbo directly.  \\\"For your bravery in the\\nface of utter danger, and the finding of the ring before Sauron did, you are held\\nin positions of highest honor amongst all hobbits in the world.  Here you will\\ndwell, amongst the Vanyar, the Noldor, and the Teleri until the end of time.  In\\norder to do so, you must be given a gift.  For all of those who dwell here posses\\nthis gift.  If you will, please kneel.  The hobbits did so, shaking slightly as they\\nbent forward.  Manwe then began chanting softly, then his voice rose into a\\nbeautiful song.  The notes were fair, and caused shivers to run down the hobbits'\\nspines, and all of the others in that hall stood silent whilst Manwe sang.  The\\nwords were undecipherable, but were strangely sweet.  The tongue was that of\\nValinor, now long forgotten in Middle-earth, save by very few.</p>\\n<p>   The hobbits then felt completely different, as if their hearts had been removed\\nof all of their sorrows, and their weariness was swept away.  They felt a feeling\\nsimilar to that of an adrenaline rush, yet their bodies remained the same.  All\\ntime seemed to have stopped before them, and they felt like they had just been\\nborn anew.  The world seemed different to their eyes, yet it was the same.\\nManwe then stopped singing, and said, \\\"I have given you the gift that only the\\nValar, the Maiar, and the Eldar posses.  You are now immortal.\\\"  The hobbits\\nrose, feeling different, yet the same.  They bowed low to the ground, and\\nthanked him for their gift, and Manwe then said, \\\"It is only fitting and proper to\\ndo such a thing to the bravest hobbits that Illuvatar, himself had ever thought of\\ncreating.\\\"</p>\\n<p>   Thus it came to be that the members of the company dwelled in Valinor.  They\\neach had a house to themselves, where they were appointed a servant.  The days\\npassed by, but time seemed to not exist to the hobbits.  Bilbo and Frodo both\\nmissed their old home of Bag End back in the Shire.  So it was their wish to\\nhave built for them a home that was much like their old one.  Thus their wish\\nwas granted, and a few of the Maiar gathered round a flat section of land nigh\\nthe center of Valmar.  There, they chanted their sweet music and caused the\\nground to rise before the hobbits' eyes.  Then with a little bit of help from the\\nhobbits, that tract of land began to take shape and form, and soon to their\\ndisbelief, it seemed as if Bag End was right before their eyes.  The Maiar bowed\\nlow when their singing was finished and stated, \\\"We have fulfilled your request,\\nand from what we have learned, it would most please you to see your old home.\\nThough this is not your old home.  It is merely a version exactly as yours used to\\nbe.  You will find that every hall and room and burrow and mark inside the hill\\nwill be exactly as you remember your old Bag End to be.</p>\\n<p>   Bilbo and Frodo both stood speechless outside their home, and could not\\nbelieve what happened before their eyes.  Bag End was before them, exactly as\\nit had been when they last saw it in the Shire before setting out upon the Great\\nEastern Road.  Their garden outside was exactly the same, filled with flowers,\\nand plants, and vegetables.  Frodo then sighed to himself and thought about\\nSam.  He would be all alone in the Shire, but hopefully he would find some way\\nto make life enjoyable.  Frodo and Bilbo entered the Hill, and found everything\\nto be exactly the same, just as that Maiar had said it would be.  All of Bilbo's\\nold possessions were there, along with Frodo's.  It was just as if they had never\\nleft home in the first place.</p>\\n<p>   Almost immediately, Bilbo began to tidy things up, because the house was just\\nhow he left it: halfway in a mess.  Frodo laughed at him and helped the old\\nhobbit around with things.  Suddenly, Frodo noticed something that he hadn't\\nbefore.  Bilbo appeared to be quite young.  A lot younger than he looked when\\nFrodo and He were riding the ship to Aman.  Bilbo looked as if he were back in\\nhis sixties!  He seemed like a bustling young hobbit with the opportunity for\\nadventure around every corner.  Bilbo never seemed to notice his regained\\nyouth, and Frodo never mentioned it to him.  He simply thought that this was\\nanother gift from the Valar.  Perhaps because the Ring caused him to never\\nchange his appearance, and once he was without the ring, his appearance\\nchanged drastically, the Valar had mercy for him, and restored his old\\nappearance.</p>\\n<p>   For many years, Frodo and Bilbo had a wonderful time in Valinor, though the\\ntime didn't seem to exist to them.  They would often gather together every day\\nwith a host of elves and Maiar, and have a jolly good time, telling stories,\\nsinging songs, and enjoying the bliss and peacefulness of the hidden realm.\\nBilbo was a very fondly loved person, for the elves of that place would listen to\\nhis tales of his journeys for hours at a time without end.  Frodo too had his great\\ndeal of attention; the elves would always ask questions about what the dark land\\nwas like, for most of them had never seen it before, first hand.  They often\\nwondered what the inside of Orodruin was like, and how Gollum was really\\nmisunderstood, but the Ring had corrupted his heart for too long.</p>\\n<p>   Thus many more years passed by, and it seemed that time did not exist to\\nFrodo.  He would often go about walking through Valinor, exploring its many\\nhidden dells and vales, and all of the joys of the gardens of Yavanna and\\nspeaking with the mightiest of the Valar, the Aratar, when he could.  From them,\\nhe learned many things about the world, and many things that no mortal man\\ndare had known.  The Valar were still very powerful and mysterious to him, and\\nhe both feared and loved them.</p>\\n<p>   During one of his explorations of the land, Frodo walked upon a fair garden,\\nwith pools of water that glittered like starlight.  Next to the largest of these pools\\nsat an elf-maiden.  Her voice was like a thousand nightingales, or all of the\\nchoruses of the Maiar put together.  Her hair was fair, and her eyes were dark\\nblue.  She was dressed in attire of light white, and she bore a smile upon her\\nface.  She was one of the Vanyar, the Highest of the Elves.  Being one of the\\nhigh elves, there was a strange oddity about her.  She was rather short for an elf.\\nShe measured nearly four feet and eight inches tall.</p>\\n<p>   Her height did not seem to bother her, and she sat beside the pool singing a\\nsong of strange sorrow.  Her sad words were sweet to hear, but one could tell\\nthat they were full of lament.  Frodo could not understand her words, for he was\\nskilled only in the language of the Silvan Elves.  She saw Frodo immediately,\\nand stopped her singing.  She smiled at him, and greeted him in her own, fair\\ntongue.  Frodo was speechless.  His feet were rooted to the ground, and he could\\nnot find any words to comment on her.  Her magnificence and beauty surpassed\\nall of the Valar and Maiar, and every other elf that he had ever seen in his life\\nbefore.  She, he accounted as the fairest creature upon the Earth.</p>\\n<p>   She smiled at him and stared at him for a long time, pondering what he might\\nbe thinking, and finally broke the silence.  She spoke in his tongue.  \\\"Greetings,\\nFrodo Baggins.  I have long been sitting by this pool alone, mourning my\\nloneliness.  Great is it that you have come to see me.  I have attended several of\\nthe telling of your stories, and have admired you for quite a long time.\\\"  Frodo\\nstood still rooted to the ground.  He grasped deep down inside for something to\\nreply with, and he thought for a long while in silence.  Finally, he found a few\\nwords. \\\"It is an honor to be admired by such a fair and lovely being as yourself.\\nSurely, you should not be mourning by this pool in the fair gardens of Valinor?\\nYou should be off dancing and singing and laughing with the rest of your\\npeople!\\\"  She smiled at his words, and said, \\\"I should be doing so.  But alas, I\\nam not comfortable being with my people.  I love them all dearly, but they all\\nmake me feel so different.  I feel small when I am with them, for I am small.  All\\nof the elves of Valinor are tall, and I am small.  It is quite lonely indeed!\\\"</p>\\n<p>   With the words, Frodo smiled, and said, \\\"But fair maiden, do not feel alone,\\nfor I myself am short, and I feel all alone, except for my dear old Bilbo.  There\\nare no other hobbits here besides him, and I indeed have longed for someone to\\nbe with.\\\"  She smiled at him, keeping her eyes steadily upon him.  Frodo felt\\nvery nervous, quite unlike he had ever felt in his life, except for a few times\\nabout a few of the female hobbits of the Shire and perhaps a few of the other\\nelves he had seen.  But he had never felt this way about an elf to this degree.\\nShe was the fairest upon the fairest of all of the Elves in his mind.</p>\\n<p>   Frodo then said, \\\"Maiden, may I ask your name of you?\\\" and she replied, \\\"My\\nname is Niwiel.  I am one of the Vanyar.\\\"  From that moment onward in the\\ntwilit gardens of the star pools, Frodo and Niwiel spent much time together.\\nThey learned a great deal about each other, and soon found that they both had a\\nlot in common.  Soon, they fell deeply in love.  So great was the love of Frodo\\nand Niwiel that they saw past their differences, and saw only each others hearts\\nand souls, and their love for each other and everything good that lived or\\ndwelled on the Earth.</p>\\n<p>   After many years of life together, Niwiel bound herself to Frodo, and in doing\\nso, they were wed.  Time passed and the happiness of Niwiel and Frodo grew\\nincredibly.  Never again would they feel alone, and Bilbo took her as an\\nimmediate part of the family.  After quite some time, Frodo and Niwiel had\\nseveral children.  These children were very special, and they were quite\\nmarveled at.  They were short in stature, and were very fair to behold, much like\\nNiwiel was.  Their ears were more sharply pointed than normal hobbits' ears,\\nand their vision was extraordinary.  In their outer appearance, they looked\\nexactly like hobbits, except for the overall fairness of their features.</p>\\n<p>   Because Niwiel and Frodo were short, their offspring were short as well.  The\\nfirst of these were two girls, and two boys.  They were very radiant to look\\nupon.  They all proved very nimble, and were swift in their movements while in\\nthe wild.  The boys' names were Feando and Daedro, and were like Frodo in\\nappearance and mind.  The girls' names were Nimrodel and Nilwe.  Niwiel\\nnamed the two girls after names that she had conceived in her mind and had\\nloved.  These four were the first of the \\\"high-hobbits\\\", the offspring of a hobbit\\nand a high-elf.</p>\\n<p>   Thus, many years of the world went past, and the \\\"hobbits\\\" continued to\\nprosper, and with the help of the Ainur, expanded their home into a massive part\\nof Valinor, which was much like the Shire, with a mixture of the woods of\\nLothlorien in it.  It was a wonderful part of the land, and belonged to the\\n\\\"hobbits\\\".  (Note that when I write \\\"hobbits\\\", I mean \\\"high-hobbits\\\".)</p>\\n<p>   After quite some time, signs of trouble began to brew once more in the lands\\nof Eastern Middle-earth.  Rumor was spreading that a dreadful power was\\nemerging once again, but who it was, was unknown.  The shadow was spreading\\nrapidly, and many forces of Uruk-Hai and Orcs who weren't already influenced\\nby it were falling under its sway.  The warriors and peoples of Middle-earth\\nwere in need of help, and most of the more experienced fighters of the Third\\nAge, who were mostly elves, had already passed away into the West.  Middle-\\nearth was in need of help.</p>\\n<p>   Hearing this, Manwe Sulimo himself was shocked, and quite disturbed.  He\\nsent petitions around to the greatest of his maiar, asking if any of them would be\\nwilling to overthrow the decision to leave the peoples of Middle-earth alone, and\\naid them in their trouble.  None of the maiar, however, would go, for they feared\\nthat if they went, they would fall sway beneath the lusts of the world.  Then,\\nManwe asked the greatest of the high-elves if they would go, but none of them\\nwished to leave their beloved peaceful lands, to go to a belligerent, hostile land,\\nwhere they would be subject to death and misery.</p>\\n<p>   His distress overcoming him, Manwe turned to the \\\"hobbits\\\".  At first, none of\\nthem were willing to leave.  However, hearing the distress of this fair Arata, a\\nhandful of them stepped forward, and accepted the task.  Manwe explained that\\nonce they left Valinor, they would never be able to return.  The newly formed\\ncompany understood this, and a leader amongst them said \\\"Fair Manwe, we\\nunderstand that we shall more than likely never see our families again, but we\\ndesire greatly to see the lands that our elders came from, and we desire ever\\nmore to protect them from harm and the evils of the world.\\\"  Manwe smiled and\\nshed a tear at this brave \\\"hobbit's\\\" bravery.</p>\\n<p>   Manwe then gathered all of the peoples of Valinor together, all around the\\noutside of Valmar.  He then announced the departure of these twelve brave\\n\\\"hobbits\\\", and bid them all farewell.  The \\\"hobbits\\\" said good-bye to their\\nfamilies, friends, and other loved-ones, and set off for the haven of Alqualonde.\\nThere, they were given a ship of mighty strength, and were blessed by the Teleri\\nwith many farewell gifts.  The ship was white, and it shone brightly in the light\\nof the sun.  The light that sparkled upon the waters of that fair bay was reflected\\nupon the base of the ship.  The figurehead was carved in the shape of a swan,\\nand the chief mariner of Alqualonde told them that it was a very fast ship, and it\\nwould not make them stray from their course as long as it was set and kept\\nstraight and true.</p>\\n<p>   Thus, the \\\"hobbits\\\" left Valinor, and turning around, saw the mighty peak of\\nTaniquetil, shining brightly in the sunlight.  They would never see Valinor\\nagain.  Their sailing was quick, and after several days, they arrived at the Grey\\nHavens of Cirdan.  There, they left their ship, and took all that they could carry\\nupon their backs.  They were each given a pack-mule to carry their gear, but\\nthese \\\"hobbits\\\" loved their mules, and spared them as much weight as each\\ncould.  They wandered over the land, and eventually ended up in the Shire.\\nThe leader of this company was Grondo Baggins.  His younger brothers, who\\nwere all fair-skinned, and beautiful to behold, accompanied him.  They were all\\nrather short and skinny, but not too chubby.  They entered the Shire, and\\nimmediately fell in love with it.  It was much like their home in Valinor, and the\\nfirst thing that caught their sight was the Hill at Bag End.  It was exactly like the\\nBag End in Valinor, and they greatly desired to keep it.  So all of that company\\npooled together their money, and bought the residence from the Gamgees who\\nlived there.  They were descendents of Samwise Gamgee.  Delighted to hear of\\ntheir last name, they offered a fair price for the place, and moved to a\\nneighboring hole.</p>\\n<p>   Thus the Bagginses were again in middle-earth.  The \\\"hobbits\\\" bound\\nthemselves to other mortal female hobbits, and in doing so, were forced to give\\nup their immortality.  Over ages, the blood of the high-hobbits dwindled, yet the\\ngenerations of Bagginses remained very nimble and fair-skinned, and fair to\\nbehold.  Over time, most of these later generations of Bagginses moved out of\\nthe Shire in search for adventure.  They came upon Rhovanion, which some call\\nWilderland.  And there now they dwell, and protect the woods from evil.</p>\\n<p>   Thus ends the History of the Bagginses of Rhovanion.  Rado Baggins,\\ndescendent of Frodo Baggins, of Bag End wrote this in Fourth Age, 2002.  I\\ngathered this information whilst on a journey westward to the Shire, and a few\\nof my elders were there to tell me in full all that had been passed down to them,\\nand all that had been written and stored away in the back rooms of Bag End.  I\\nam pleased to share this with you, and I wish that you will enjoy this knowledge\\nand pass it along to your friends and family.</p>\\n<p>Rado Baggins, Green Ranger of Gondor</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"The History of Bagginses of Rhovanion\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"/books/bagginsesofrhovanion\"}}\n\n/***/ })\n\n});\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// path---books-bagginsesofrhovanion-ba4cbf68038486a87783.js","module.exports = {\"data\":{\"markdownRemark\":{\"html\":\"<p>   Ere the dawn of the Fourth Age of the World, Frodo Baggins, Bilbo Baggins,\\nGandalf the Grey, who is known by many other names, and a few others who\\nhad a part in the great and extensive History of the Ring, left the lands of\\nMiddle-earth towards the Blessed Realm.

The three were speaking loudly, and clearly, so that Frodo and Bilbo\\ncould hear their conversation.  While they listened, they were reminded once more\\nthat Gandalf was one of the Maiar, a people of the Valar.  He had not always been\\nknown by as Gandalf.

She\\nmentioned that Celeborn had chosen to stay in Lothlorien for a while yet to enjoy his\\nlast days upon those fair Golden Woods.

The histories of these\\npeople had been great and extensive, and for that reason, they shall not be told here.</p>\\n<p>   Now Bilbo and Frodo were filled with joy and gladness at hearing the happiness of\\nall of these people.  Before, Galadriel had seemed filled with a lot of grief, and\\nsadness.  But now, she seemed a young elf-maiden, filled with happiness and bereft of\\nher woes.  Both Bilbo and Frodo smiled and joined in a few of the songs that the elves\\nsang, and forgot about their worries for a while.</p>\\n<p>   After many days of sailing upon those tranquil, crystal clear waters, they began to\\nsee a massive pinnacle of stone rise up out of the horizon.  All of the elves stood up\\nand shouted for joy, causing their songs to rise up and laughter to fill the air.  Some of\\nthem proclaimed, \\\"Taniquetil! Home of Manwe Sulimo, King of Arda!  There too\\ndwells Varda Elentari, Queen of the Stars! A Elbereth! Gilthoniel! silivren penna\\nmiriel o menel aglar elenath! Na-chaered palan-diriel o galadhremmin ennorath,\\nFanuilos, le linnathon nef aear, si nef aearon!\\\"  This they sang, and the rest of the\\nverses of the song, in reverence to their Queen that they would soon meet.</p>\\n<p>   The hobbits were filled with a sudden joy, for they had never seen a pinnacle so\\nhigh and mighty before in their lives.  The ship seemed to be gaining speed, and the\\nhorizon began to be filled with glorious, lofty mountains.  Taniquetil stood amidst\\nthose mountains, living up to its name as the highest mountain in all of Arda.  Frodo\\nwas filled with a sudden short fear, for he had never before realized what majesty the\\nrealm of the Valar had actually held.  He then realized that he was only viewing the\\noutermost part of Valinor, the Pelori, those mountains that had been raised by the\\nValar as a defense against Melkor and the evils that he had wrought.</p>\\n<p>   The ship landed upon the shore of Valinor, and many tall elves, with incredibly\\nbright faces greeted the ship.  They were filled with great mirth, for they were finally\\nmeeting the lost ones of their Kindred.  These elves were known as the Sea-elves, a\\nbranch of the Teleri.  These elves dwelt at Alqualonde, the haven of the Teleri.  These\\nelves were called Sea-elves, for their love of the sea, and of sailing.  Of all of the elves\\nin Middle-earth, these were the ones who were the most skilled at shipbuilding and\\nsailing.  There, the company was received with great joy and happiness, and were\\ntaken into the homes of the Teleri for several days and housed, fed, and told of the\\ngoings-on of the time.</p>\\n<p>   A few days passed, and it came time to go before Manwe Sulimo, in order to receive\\ntheir official welcome to Valinor.  Thus the company did, and the whole way there,\\nthe hobbits were filled with a small fear, yet their hearts were filled with joy.  They\\ntraveled up the slopes of Taniquetil, and found at the top a massive mansion, overlaid\\nwith the richest jewels and stones of the entire world.  They entered, and many Maiar\\nand other noble lords of the Valar stood.  Eonwe, the Herald of Manwe was there, and\\nhe greeted them with a deep bow.  He beckoned them to follow him down an\\nincredibly, richly decorated hall.</p>\\n<p>   The hall opened up into a massive chamber, which was adorned with many\\npaintings and jewels, and the airs of the world could be seen as the ceiling.  Thus\\nEonwe proclaimed, \\\"Lord Manwe, King of Arda, here are the members of the alliance\\nof the Ring!\\\"  He announced all of their names, and titles, and then bowed low to the\\nground, and stepped back.  The members of the company bowed low in return, and\\nfell to their knees before Manwe.  Manwe smiled, and bade them to stand.  He then\\nstood long silent, staring and pondering at each individual.  After a long silence, he\\nfinally spoke.  His voice was soft, understanding, stern, compassionate, and powerful.</p>\\n<p> \\\"Your deeds have not gone unheard, friends.  It is a wonderful thing that you now\\nstand before me in my court.  For your deeds and troubles in the lands, it is only\\nappropriate that you dwell in Valinor, and remain here ere the end of the world.\\nOlorin, it greatly saddens me to hear that Alatar and Pallando have not been heard of\\nand supposedly still dwell in the lands of East Middle-earth.  Sorrow filled my heart\\nwhen I heard that Curumo had betrayed us, and had decided to join Sauron and his\\nevil thoughts.  Folly it was when Sauron joined Melkor and his foul plans during the\\nGreat Music.  But alas!  He is now vanquished, and his power is gone!\\\"  Each of the\\ncompany stood silent in awe and amazement of the power of Manwe, and his\\nsplendor.</p>\\n<p>   Manwe then addressed Frodo and Bilbo directly.  \\\"For your bravery in the\\nface of utter danger, and the finding of the ring before Sauron did, you are held\\nin positions of highest honor amongst all hobbits in the world.  Here you will\\ndwell, amongst the Vanyar, the Noldor, and the Teleri until the end of time.  In\\norder to do so, you must be given a gift.  For all of those who dwell here posses\\nthis gift.  If you will, please kneel.  The hobbits did so, shaking slightly as they\\nbent forward.  Manwe then began chanting softly, then his voice rose into a\\nbeautiful song.  The notes were fair, and caused shivers to run down the hobbits'\\nspines, and all of the others in that hall stood silent whilst Manwe sang.  The\\nwords were undecipherable, but were strangely sweet.  The tongue was that of\\nValinor, now long forgotten in Middle-earth, save by very few.</p>\\n<p>   The hobbits then felt completely different, as if their hearts had been removed\\nof all of their sorrows, and their weariness was swept away.  They felt a feeling\\nsimilar to that of an adrenaline rush, yet their bodies remained the same.  All\\ntime seemed to have stopped before them, and they felt like they had just been\\nborn anew.  The world seemed different to their eyes, yet it was the same.\\nManwe then stopped singing, and said, \\\"I have given you the gift that only the\\nValar, the Maiar, and the Eldar posses.  You are now immortal.\\\"  The hobbits\\nrose, feeling different, yet the same.  They bowed low to the ground, and\\nthanked him for their gift, and Manwe then said, \\\"It is only fitting and proper to\\ndo such a thing to the bravest hobbits that Illuvatar, himself had ever thought of\\ncreating.\\\"</p>\\n<p>   Thus it came to be that the members of the company dwelled in Valinor.  They\\neach had a house to themselves, where they were appointed a servant.  The days\\npassed by, but time seemed to not exist to the hobbits.  Bilbo and Frodo both\\nmissed their old home of Bag End back in the Shire.  So it was their wish to\\nhave built for them a home that was much like their old one.  Thus their wish\\nwas granted, and a few of the Maiar gathered round a flat section of land nigh\\nthe center of Valmar.  There, they chanted their sweet music and caused the\\nground to rise before the hobbits' eyes.  Then with a little bit of help from the\\nhobbits, that tract of land began to take shape and form, and soon to their\\ndisbelief, it seemed as if Bag End was right before their eyes.  The Maiar bowed\\nlow when their singing was finished and stated, \\\"We have fulfilled your request,\\nand from what we have learned, it would most please you to see your old home.\\nThough this is not your old home.  It is merely a version exactly as yours used to\\nbe.  You will find that every hall and room and burrow and mark inside the hill\\nwill be exactly as you remember your old Bag End to be.</p>\\n<p>   Bilbo and Frodo both stood speechless outside their home, and could not\\nbelieve what happened before their eyes.  Bag End was before them, exactly as\\nit had been when they last saw it in the Shire before setting out upon the Great\\nEastern Road.  Their garden outside was exactly the same, filled with flowers,\\nand plants, and vegetables.  Frodo then sighed to himself and thought about\\nSam.  He would be all alone in the Shire, but hopefully he would find some way\\nto make life enjoyable.  Frodo and Bilbo entered the Hill, and found everything\\nto be exactly the same, just as that Maiar had said it would be.  All of Bilbo's\\nold possessions were there, along with Frodo's.  It was just as if they had never\\nleft home in the first place.</p>\\n<p>   Almost immediately, Bilbo began to tidy things up, because the house was just\\nhow he left it: halfway in a mess.  Frodo laughed at him and helped the old\\nhobbit around with things.  Suddenly, Frodo noticed something that he hadn't\\nbefore.  Bilbo appeared to be quite young.  A lot younger than he looked when\\nFrodo and He were riding the ship to Aman.  Bilbo looked as if he were back in\\nhis sixties!  He seemed like a bustling young hobbit with the opportunity for\\nadventure around every corner.  Bilbo never seemed to notice his regained\\nyouth, and Frodo never mentioned it to him.  He simply thought that this was\\nanother gift from the Valar.  Perhaps because the Ring caused him to never\\nchange his appearance, and once he was without the ring, his appearance\\nchanged drastically, the Valar had mercy for him, and restored his old\\nappearance.</p>\\n<p>   For many years, Frodo and Bilbo had a wonderful time in Valinor, though the\\ntime didn't seem to exist to them.  They would often gather together every day\\nwith a host of elves and Maiar, and have a jolly good time, telling stories,\\nsinging songs, and enjoying the bliss and peacefulness of the hidden realm.\\nBilbo was a very fondly loved person, for the elves of that place would listen to\\nhis tales of his journeys for hours at a time without end.  Frodo too had his great\\ndeal of attention; the elves would always ask questions about what the dark land\\nwas like, for most of them had never seen it before, first hand.  They often\\nwondered what the inside of Orodruin was like, and how Gollum was really\\nmisunderstood, but the Ring had corrupted his heart for too long.</p>\\n<p>   Thus many more years passed by, and it seemed that time did not exist to\\nFrodo.  He would often go about walking through Valinor, exploring its many\\nhidden dells and vales, and all of the joys of the gardens of Yavanna and\\nspeaking with the mightiest of the Valar, the Aratar, when he could.  From them,\\nhe learned many things about the world, and many things that no mortal man\\ndare had known.  The Valar were still very powerful and mysterious to him, and\\nhe both feared and loved them.</p>\\n<p>   During one of his explorations of the land, Frodo walked upon a fair garden,\\nwith pools of water that glittered like starlight.  Next to the largest of these pools\\nsat an elf-maiden.  Her voice was like a thousand nightingales, or all of the\\nchoruses of the Maiar put together.  Her hair was fair, and her eyes were dark\\nblue.  She was dressed in attire of light white, and she bore a smile upon her\\nface.  She was one of the Vanyar, the Highest of the Elves.  Being one of the\\nhigh elves, there was a strange oddity about her.  She was rather short for an elf.\\nShe measured nearly four feet and eight inches tall.</p>\\n<p>   Her height did not seem to bother her, and she sat beside the pool singing a\\nsong of strange sorrow.  Her sad words were sweet to hear, but one could tell\\nthat they were full of lament.  Frodo could not understand her words, for he was\\nskilled only in the language of the Silvan Elves.  She saw Frodo immediately,\\nand stopped her singing.  She smiled at him, and greeted him in her own, fair\\ntongue.  Frodo was speechless.  His feet were rooted to the ground, and he could\\nnot find any words to comment on her.  Her magnificence and beauty surpassed\\nall of the Valar and Maiar, and every other elf that he had ever seen in his life\\nbefore.  She, he accounted as the fairest creature upon the Earth.</p>\\n<p>   She smiled at him and stared at him for a long time, pondering what he might\\nbe thinking, and finally broke the silence.  She spoke in his tongue.  \\\"Greetings,\\nFrodo Baggins.  I have long been sitting by this pool alone, mourning my\\nloneliness.  Great is it that you have come to see me.  I have attended several of\\nthe telling of your stories, and have admired you for quite a long time.\\\"  Frodo\\nstood still rooted to the ground.  He grasped deep down inside for something to\\nreply with, and he thought for a long while in silence.  Finally, he found a few\\nwords. \\\"It is an honor to be admired by such a fair and lovely being as yourself.\\nSurely, you should not be mourning by this pool in the fair gardens of Valinor?\\nYou should be off dancing and singing and laughing with the rest of your\\npeople!\\\"  She smiled at his words, and said, \\\"I should be doing so.  But alas, I\\nam not comfortable being with my people.  I love them all dearly, but they all\\nmake me feel so different.  I feel small when I am with them, for I am small.  All\\nof the elves of Valinor are tall, and I am small.  It is quite lonely indeed!\\\"</p>\\n<p>   With the words, Frodo smiled, and said, \\\"But fair maiden, do not feel alone,\\nfor I myself am short, and I feel all alone, except for my dear old Bilbo.  There\\nare no other hobbits here besides him, and I indeed have longed for someone to\\nbe with.\\\"  She smiled at him, keeping her eyes steadily upon him.  Frodo felt\\nvery nervous, quite unlike he had ever felt in his life, except for a few times\\nabout a few of the female hobbits of the Shire and perhaps a few of the other\\nelves he had seen.  But he had never felt this way about an elf to this degree.\\nShe was the fairest upon the fairest of all of the Elves in his mind.</p>\\n<p>   Frodo then said, \\\"Maiden, may I ask your name of you?\\\" and she replied, \\\"My\\nname is Niwiel.  I am one of the Vanyar.\\\"  From that moment onward in the\\ntwilit gardens of the star pools, Frodo and Niwiel spent much time together.\\nThey learned a great deal about each other, and soon found that they both had a\\nlot in common.  Soon, they fell deeply in love.  So great was the love of Frodo\\nand Niwiel that they saw past their differences, and saw only each others hearts\\nand souls, and their love for each other and everything good that lived or\\ndwelled on the Earth.</p>\\n<p>   After many years of life together, Niwiel bound herself to Frodo, and in doing\\nso, they were wed.  Time passed and the happiness of Niwiel and Frodo grew\\nincredibly.  Never again would they feel alone, and Bilbo took her as an\\nimmediate part of the family.  After quite some time, Frodo and Niwiel had\\nseveral children.  These children were very special, and they were quite\\nmarveled at.  They were short in stature, and were very fair to behold, much like\\nNiwiel was.  Their ears were more sharply pointed than normal hobbits' ears,\\nand their vision was extraordinary.  In their outer appearance, they looked\\nexactly like hobbits, except for the overall fairness of their features.</p>\\n<p>   Because Niwiel and Frodo were short, their offspring were short as well.  The\\nfirst of these were two girls, and two boys.  They were very radiant to look\\nupon.  They all proved very nimble, and were swift in their movements while in\\nthe wild.  The boys' names were Feando and Daedro, and were like Frodo in\\nappearance and mind.  The girls' names were Nimrodel and Nilwe.  Niwiel\\nnamed the two girls after names that she had conceived in her mind and had\\nloved.  These four were the first of the \\\"high-hobbits\\\", the offspring of a hobbit\\nand a high-elf.</p>\\n<p>   Thus, many years of the world went past, and the \\\"hobbits\\\" continued to\\nprosper, and with the help of the Ainur, expanded their home into a massive part\\nof Valinor, which was much like the Shire, with a mixture of the woods of\\nLothlorien in it.  It was a wonderful part of the land, and belonged to the\\n\\\"hobbits\\\".  (Note that when I write \\\"hobbits\\\", I mean \\\"high-hobbits\\\".)</p>\\n<p>   After quite some time, signs of trouble began to brew once more in the lands\\nof Eastern Middle-earth.  Rumor was spreading that a dreadful power was\\nemerging once again, but who it was, was unknown.  The shadow was spreading\\nrapidly, and many forces of Uruk-Hai and Orcs who weren't already influenced\\nby it were falling under its sway.  The warriors and peoples of Middle-earth\\nwere in need of help, and most of the more experienced fighters of the Third\\nAge, who were mostly elves, had already passed away into the West.  Middle-\\nearth was in need of help.</p>\\n<p>   Hearing this, Manwe Sulimo himself was shocked, and quite disturbed.  He\\nsent petitions around to the greatest of his maiar, asking if any of them would be\\nwilling to overthrow the decision to leave the peoples of Middle-earth alone, and\\naid them in their trouble.  None of the maiar, however, would go, for they feared\\nthat if they went, they would fall sway beneath the lusts of the world.  Then,\\nManwe asked the greatest of the high-elves if they would go, but none of them\\nwished to leave their beloved peaceful lands, to go to a belligerent, hostile land,\\nwhere they would be subject to death and misery.</p>\\n<p>   His distress overcoming him, Manwe turned to the \\\"hobbits\\\".  At first, none of\\nthem were willing to leave.  However, hearing the distress of this fair Arata, a\\nhandful of them stepped forward, and accepted the task.  Manwe explained that\\nonce they left Valinor, they would never be able to return.  The newly formed\\ncompany understood this, and a leader amongst them said \\\"Fair Manwe, we\\nunderstand that we shall more than likely never see our families again, but we\\ndesire greatly to see the lands that our elders came from, and we desire ever\\nmore to protect them from harm and the evils of the world.\\\"  Manwe smiled and\\nshed a tear at this brave \\\"hobbit's\\\" bravery.</p>\\n<p>   Manwe then gathered all of the peoples of Valinor together, all around the\\noutside of Valmar.  He then announced the departure of these twelve brave\\n\\\"hobbits\\\", and bid them all farewell.  The \\\"hobbits\\\" said good-bye to their\\nfamilies, friends, and other loved-ones, and set off for the haven of Alqualonde.\\nThere, they were given a ship of mighty strength, and were blessed by the Teleri\\nwith many farewell gifts.  The ship was white, and it shone brightly in the light\\nof the sun.  The light that sparkled upon the waters of that fair bay was reflected\\nupon the base of the ship.  The figurehead was carved in the shape of a swan,\\nand the chief mariner of Alqualonde told them that it was a very fast ship, and it\\nwould not make them stray from their course as long as it was set and kept\\nstraight and true.</p>\\n<p>   Thus, the \\\"hobbits\\\" left Valinor, and turning around, saw the mighty peak of\\nTaniquetil, shining brightly in the sunlight.  They would never see Valinor\\nagain.  Their sailing was quick, and after several days, they arrived at the Grey\\nHavens of Cirdan.  There, they left their ship, and took all that they could carry\\nupon their backs.  They were each given a pack-mule to carry their gear, but\\nthese \\\"hobbits\\\" loved their mules, and spared them as much weight as each\\ncould.  They wandered over the land, and eventually ended up in the Shire.\\nThe leader of this company was Grondo Baggins.  His younger brothers, who\\nwere all fair-skinned, and beautiful to behold, accompanied him.  They were all\\nrather short and skinny, but not too chubby.  They entered the Shire, and\\nimmediately fell in love with it.  It was much like their home in Valinor, and the\\nfirst thing that caught their sight was the Hill at Bag End.  It was exactly like the\\nBag End in Valinor, and they greatly desired to keep it.  So all of that company\\npooled together their money, and bought the residence from the Gamgees who\\nlived there.  They were descendents of Samwise Gamgee.  Delighted to hear of\\ntheir last name, they offered a fair price for the place, and moved to a\\nneighboring hole.</p>\\n<p>   Thus the Bagginses were again in middle-earth.  The \\\"hobbits\\\" bound\\nthemselves to other mortal female hobbits, and in doing so, were forced to give\\nup their immortality.  Over ages, the blood of the high-hobbits dwindled, yet the\\ngenerations of Bagginses remained very nimble and fair-skinned, and fair to\\nbehold.  Over time, most of these later generations of Bagginses moved out of\\nthe Shire in search for adventure.  They came upon Rhovanion, which some call\\nWilderland.  And there now they dwell, and protect the woods from evil.</p>\\n<p>   Thus ends the History of the Bagginses of Rhovanion.  Rado Baggins,\\ndescendent of Frodo Baggins, of Bag End wrote this in Fourth Age, 2002.  I\\ngathered this information whilst on a journey westward to the Shire, and a few\\nof my elders were there to tell me in full all that had been passed down to them,\\nand all that had been written and stored away in the back rooms of Bag End.  I\\nam pleased to share this with you, and I wish that you will enjoy this knowledge\\nand pass it along to your friends and family.</p>\\n<p>Rado Baggins, Green Ranger of Gondor</p>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"title\":\"The History of Bagginses of Rhovanion\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"/books/bagginsesofrhovanion\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/books-bagginsesofrhovanion.json\n// module id = 659\n// module chunks = 177607049777177"],"sourceRoot":""}
