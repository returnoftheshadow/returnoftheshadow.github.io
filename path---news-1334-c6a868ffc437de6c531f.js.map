Cooperation does include communication,\\nthough not sitting in the same room and 'chatting it up'. Yells are\\nacceptable, since you do not know if the enemy is attempting to lie to you or\\nnot. The following is entirely inappropriate behaviour: Grouping of any kind,\\ncooperation when no whities are present, conversation in the same room without\\nfighting, casting of helpful spells, dropping/giving/exchanging equipment of\\nany kind, assisting in the killing of a mob or completion of a quest.
