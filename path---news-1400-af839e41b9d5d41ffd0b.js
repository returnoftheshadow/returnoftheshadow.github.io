The general\nphilosophy on skills is there should be few "must have" skills, and more\nskills that give people options. Taking into account responses to my\nquestion on whitie board, some changes will go in before others are done.</p>\n<p>Changes this time around are:</p>\n<p>SHIELD SPELL: Bug fixed. Shield now should, as intended, take much more mana than before -- a nasty bug\nprevented it from working properly. After bug fix, mana taken was reduced a\nbit, to make shield slightly more powerful than intended (but still much  less\nso than it was before the bug fix). Note that it was intended as a situational\nspell -- it should not be a no-brainer to keep it up all the time. To help\nwith that, its casting time has been reduced.</p>\n<p>AMBSUH: Damage and probabily of success depend less on level and skill now\nthan before (though both are still very important). Ambush was never\nintended to be a one-shot kill, but it should still do quite a bit of\ndamage. Lower level rangers will findd ambush easier, while higher level\nrangers will find it do less damage.</p>\n<p>SNEAK: Sneak delay now depends on ranger level, the higher ranger level,\nthe less sneak delay</p>\n<p>-Dim</p>',frontmatter:{title:"News 1400",date:"October 09, 2017",author:"Dim",desc:"Balance Changes"}}},pathContext:{path:"/news/1400"}}}});
