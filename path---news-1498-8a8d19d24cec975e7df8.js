'Well laddie, not quite, we managed to sneak you in two\nbarrels of good olde fashioned dragons breath whiskey! You know for the\ncelebrations!' replied a stout grinning Dwarf.   'Excellent news' replied\nAoran 'Ill go load all this stuff into the cellar, then I can go about\norganising the food. Ive had to order in more from the local farmers, I dont\nknow who is worse, dwarves or hobbits for eating one out of house and home'.\n'Nothing beats a celebration laddie, and this is going to be a goodin' replied\nthe grinning dwarf.  Laughing to himself Aoran began the task of moving the\nlarge quantities of food and drink into the already crowded storage cellar of\nthe Sword and Shield. 'Tomorrow night will be a night to remember' he mused.\nTaking one of the many oil lamps  scattered about the inns common room he made\nhis way slowly down into the dark cellar. The work was harder than usual he\nhad never seen the cellar as full in all the long years he had worked here,\nbut the occasion warranted it. A special envoy from Gondor (rumoured to be of\nthe royal line itself) was arriving tomorrow, and the Sword and Shield was\nchosen to host an important meeting between Gondor and the Dwarven realm of\nErebor. These 'meetings' usually ended up becoming a rampant celebration of\nthe friendship enjoyed between the two kingdoms as such a copious amount of\nale and wine was brought for all to enjoy.   A shrill voice cut through the\nair. 'Aoron, you had better not be delaying down there, we have work to do'.</p>\n<p>Snapped out of his reverie, Aoron quickly made his way up the spiral staircase\ninto the cooks kitchen. Closing the cellar door tight behind him,  he ran to\nanswer his employers call. With a crooked half smile on his face, he chuckled\n'This is going to be one of those days'.    Like all hard days work, it passed\nwith surprising speed. Day quickly fell into night, and before Aoron knew it\nhe was shutting up the Inn for the evening unaware that it would be for the\nlast time.  Below the trapdoor in the cooks kitchen, the usually pitch black\ncellar was basking in a haunting orange hue, the type of glow that accompanies\nfire. The oil lamp used earlier to illuminate the perpetual darkness was\nuncovered and had burnt low. The wick had fragmented and its hot remains had\nfallen on an open crate of Longbottom leaf. Quickly consuming the dried\ntinder, the fire spread among the crates and barrels  until the entire cellar\nwas ablaze. In the corner of the cellar the two barrels of Dragons breath\nwhiskey, along with many crates of spirits began to burn.   At the western\ngate to the city four Vinyanost guards were keeping vigil on what was a quite\nnight. Suddenly and without warning a thunderous concussion noise rent the\nair.  Shards of rubble began to rain from the air. Shields! shouted the most\nsenior guard. Trumpets rang out throughout the night air, as guards and\ncitizens alike were roused from their sleep coming out of their homes all\nlooked on in horror, as the explosion that had roused them had rained down\nburning rubble upon a portion of the city.  A company of royal Gondorian\nhousehold guards roused from their sleep by a deep thud, looked northward over</p>\n<p>the grassy Anduin plain. Several miles lay between them and its source but the\nglowing red sky told them all they needed to know.   'Make ready! fast march,\nfall into formation, we ride this hour'. 'Keep your eyes sharp and swords\nready!' shouted the commanding officer. Riding along side his superior a young\nknight spoke 'Sir, is it an attack?'.  'Im not sure Irildean, either way\nVinyanost burns.' With that the company broke camp hastily and rode with all\nspeed northwards.   The frigid predawn cold brought with it fog from the great\nriver, helping the effort to douse the fire that consumed the city overnight.\nAt midday the company of Gondorian knights entered what remained of the city\nof Vinyanost, now smouldering in a cold drizzle. The streets were covered in a\nblack soot the people black faced were cold and huddling in groups trying to\nkeep warm.  'Lieutenant' bellowed the captain of the Gondorian forces.  'Sir'\nreplied a tall blond man.  Inhaling deeply the captain spoke 'Make camp, set\nup a tent for the injured. Get every able bodied man and woman to search the\nrubble for survivors. Send riders north for help. Organise hunting and logging\ndetails, and set up a fortified perimeter around the old barracks. These\npeople need food, shelter and fire. Go.'   'Sir' replied the young lieutenant.\nScratching his head the captain grimaced. 'One more thing Lieutenant, send out\nscouts east of the Anduin, I want to know if something is coming before it\narrives. That fire last night could have been seen for miles around.'  Nodding\nto himself the young lieutenant barked one final 'Sir' and was off.   Turning\nto survey the full extent of the damage done, the captain uttered one final</p>\n<h2>word. 'Damm'.</h2>\n<p>For the full non rots formatting botched version, see rotsmud.org.\nOOC Vinyanost has been destroyed, a small makeshift camp has been put in place\nuntil its been completely redeveloped.\nMany thanks go to Azriya, Ramus, Elagor, Salia, Kandi and myself.
