That type of language will not be\ntolerated, as has been stated in the news many times in the past.  Racial\nslurs, sexual slurs, sexual harrassment, religious slurs and the like will be\npunished upon discovery - NO MATTER WHAT THE CONTEXT WAS.  The will be no\nmercy for this type of nonsense - no matter who you are, or if you are "very\nbest friends" with the player who is the target.  If you want to be racist or\na bigot then do it somewhere else, you are not welcome here.</p>',frontmatter:{title:"News 1194: A Punishment",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1194"}}}});
