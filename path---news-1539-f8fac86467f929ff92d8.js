The early reports have been scattered, and relatively\nvague; they tell of the ground moving, shaking, even opening in places to\nreveal great chasms and caves. As the reports continue to come in, they\nbecome much more grim; they tell of aftershocks, small tremors, of friend\nand foe alike buried in collapses while exploring what appears to be an\nenormous underground cave system.</p>\n<p>(OOC: A large underground cave system is now accessible beneath southern\nMirkwood. It has numerous connection points to the zones above. This area\nis dangerous, both the environment and the mobiles, so those exploring it\nshould be cautious. There are a number of new quests connected with this\nzone, for all sides of the war, and one is very long and has multiple possible\nendings. There are things to interest every race. And one final comment: even\nif you explore the entire area your first visit, it is very unlikely that you\nwill have seen or found all that there is to see and find.</p>\n<p>P>news next\nMessage 1541 : Sat Oct  6 (Blent)      :: Miscellaneous Changes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Disturbed by the recent earthquake, the black huorn has become less tree-\nlike and more active.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The dwarven armorer in Erebor has had two notable events in his life\nrecently, one more serious than the other.

A sudden series of knocks came at the\nheavy gate of the fortress.  The gatekeeper saw a tall grey haired man,\nclothed in green, and recognized him as a ranger from Mirkwood.  When Vincent\nentered the fortress, he asked to be taken directly to Logan.  Upon meeting\nwith the captain, he related a tale of violence and magic.  "The evil races of\nMirkwood are warring again.  I  was out hunting deer near my tent when I heard\na large party approaching on the road.  I hid in the undergrowth and was very\nsurprised to see a war party of dreaded Uruk-Lhuth thunder past me on the Old\nForest Road.  Magus himself was in the lead, followed by no less than 50 of\nthose evil magic orcs. After they passed, I tracked them  a ways, seeing the\ntracks turn north, into the mountains.  Silently I followed  the tracks to\nUngorod!  From a hidden peak I watched a mighty battle ensue,  as the old\nenemies Magus and the Chieftain led their forces against each other.   Many of\nthe Uruk-Hai fled like cowards, running south into the forest while   Magus\nwas busy relishing his victory.  The mountain fortress of Ungorod now  is held\nby the Lhuth."  Logan frowned, and replied "That may well be to our advantage.\nMayhap the road is safer with those foul Lhuth further from it. Only time will\ntell."</p>\n<p>OOC:  Many changes have been made in the east.  There are new quests for\nthe all races.  Please report anything strange to immortals.  If none are\nonline please mudmail me.</p>\n<p>Also, flails have undergone some tweaks.  No tradeins should be needed.</p>\n<p>In addition, there is a new smob in the south of Mirkwood.</p>\n<p>Credits:\nTuramarth - Design, building, testing\nLowtax - Design, building, scripting, testing\nAdunakhor - Building, testing\nRathmanken - building\nIngolemo - coding, scripting\nAzriya - generally being a nuisance</p>',frontmatter:{title:"News 1539: Earthquake in Southern Mirkwood",date:"October 09, 2017",author:null,desc:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1539"}}}});
