webpackJsonp([0xffa69645dd8d],{541:function(e,i){e.exports={data:{markdownRemark:{html:'<h3>General Context:</h3>\n<p>This is a bugfix and first-pass specialization patch.  The\nspecializations that have been added/adjusted have not had\ntheir power budgets adjusted too much, so everything should\nremain more-or-less where it is power wise.  This means\nthat most of the warrior specs are a bit light in what they\ndo (since most warrior power is passive), and the mage and\nmystic specs are a little bit homogenous.</p>\n<h3>Bug fixes/balance tweaks:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue with Big Brother protection and mentaling.</li>\n<li>Fixed curse-flee-die bug, so killer will now get credit.</li>\n<li>Orcs get a notification when followers can\'t wield something.</li>\n<li>Lowbie bonus health and mana regen has been reduced.</li>\n<li>Health is now set to 1/4 HP from 1 HP on player death.</li>\n<li>Some orc follower/following fixes.</li>\n<li>Orc recruits no longer lose moves when they are lost.</li>\n<li>Big Brother\'s lowbie protection has been reduced</li>\n<li>Level 10 is the maximum safe level now.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mages:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reworked how the spell save system works.  This should lead to smobs saving less frequently against spells, and players saving slightly more frequently.</li>\n<li>Specializations now add an effective 6 flat mage levels instead of offering less power the higher level mage the character was.</li>\n<li>Nerfed chill ray/shout of pain\'s lock-out. (Can no longer reduce the victim\'s energy below 0.)</li>\n<li>Elemental specializations now enhance different spells in different ways.  They no longer grant resistance or vulnerability, but instead make it easier/harder to save against spells of the same/opposing element.</li>\n<li>Added lightning and darkness specializations.</li>\n<li>Protection spec applies to "shield" spell, and regen spec applies to "cure self" and "vitalize self".</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Mystics:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Specializations now add an effective 6 flat mystic levels\ninstead of offering less power the higher level mystic the\ncharacter was.</li>\n<li>Changed how "Resist Magic" works to fit into the new spell\nsave system.</li>\n<li>Protection spec now enhances "Resist Magic" and "Evasion".</li>\n<li>Spirits now grant 3x the spirit.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Rangers:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ambush damage has been nerfed for non-stealth rangers.</li>\n<li>Tames for animal spec rangers get bonus damage.</li>\n<li>Added Archery Specialization - allows different casting\nspeeds, allowing to focus either on quick shots or\nconserving ammunition.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Wariors:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added "Heavy Fighting", "Light Fighting", and "Defender"\nspecializations.</li>\n<li>Heavy Fighting warriors excel at fighting in heavy armor\nand using big, bulky weapons.  When wearing heavy armor,\nthey suffer less encumbrance than other characters.  When\nusing heavy weapons, they swing faster or harder.</li>\n<li>Light Fighting warriors excel at quick strikes.  They can\noccasionally double-strike.</li>\n<li>Defender warriors excel at protecting themselves.  They\nare more durable, and can block attacks.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Orcs:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Orc mage followers now know all spells that they can cast\nto 100% knowledge (this should reduce cast failures).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Things to watch for/impressions:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I am unsure if the chill ray nerf will end up being too\nsteep. If it looks that way, we can tone it down a bit.\nI expect that with smobs having a harder time saving\nagainst spells, it should be in an alright spot.</li>\n<li>Archery and stealth specs may be a little bit undertuned.</li>\n<li>Mystic specs that aren\'t illusion or guardian are still probably a bit undertuned.</li>\n<li>All warrior specs need work in order to better emphasize\nthe strength of the spec.  This is going to require some\nbalance work elsewhere though.</li>\n</ul>',frontmatter:{title:"News 1661",date:"October 09, 2017",author:"Drelidan",desc:"v1.0.3 Patch Notes"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/news/1661"}}}});
